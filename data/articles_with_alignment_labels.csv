On 1 January 2025, the UK's new regime for regulating digital markets, set out in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act 2024 (DMCCA), came into force. Since then, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has wasted no time in using its new powers, with investigations into Google's search and search advertising activities, Google and Apple's mobile ecosystems, and provisional findings in the CMA's cloud market investigation. At the same time, however, significant publicity has been generated by the Government's decision to replace the CMA's former Chair, Marcus Bokkerink, with Doug Gurr, formerly of Amazon's UK and China business units; and it remains to be seen whether this change in leadership will lead to a change in approach. In this blog post, we summarise the CMA's busy January and even busier year ahead and what this might mean for businesses across various sectors with touchpoints into digital markets.
The new digital markets regime: designate-then-regulate
In our DMCCA briefing series, linked here, we summarised the key features of the UK's new digital markets regime. In short, the DMCCA sets up a 'designate-then-regulate' system in which the CMA will, following an investigation:
The first two SMS investigations
With the digital markets regime going live on 1 January 2025, the CMA showed little signs of a New Years Day hangover. On 7 January, the CMA set its roadmap for 2025, with two investigations to be launched in January and a third later in the year (likely in May/June)1. True to its word, the CMA launched its first investigation - into Google's general search and search activities - exactly one week later 2. The following week, the CMA fired the starting gun for its second investigation, this time into Google and Apple's mobile ecosystems, broadly capturing operating systems, app stores and mobile browsers 3. Both of these investigations build on the CMA's prior work in relation to these services (described further below).
A few key points are worth noting in relation to these two investigations.
Instead, it is the potential remedies - which the CMA has signalled it will investigate ""in parallel"" to considering designation - that are more likely to be the focus of attention and efforts. And when considering what remedies are 'on the table' in the coming months...
The CMA's 9 month review timelines do not tell the full story. Experience in the EU with regards to its digital markets regime suggests that there may be judicial challenges to the CMA's decision-making which could further delay actual implementation of any designations and remedies.
CMA's verdict on cloud market
Less than a week after its second SMS investigation, the CMA published its provisional decision in its market investigation into the supply of public cloud infrastructure services in the UK - which has ultimately trailed another SMS investigation in the pipeline 7.
The CMA's investigation in relation to cloud services again builds upon a significant body of prior work. The CMA's market investigation directly follows on from an initial market study carried out by Ofcom, allowing it to borrow on the latter's sectoral expertise. The CMA has also previously looked at cloud gaming in the context of its Microsoft/ Activision merger review, and can also learn from the French Autorité de la Concurrence's in-depth review into cloud services. For a more detailed overview of the various competition law developments in relation to cloud services, please see our blog post here.
Even though the CMA's findings are only provisional at this stage, the report remains a highly-significant piece of work. The report numbers 513 pages accompanied by no less than 23 appendices and builds on the detailed market study already carried out by Ofcom. In its report, the CMA has identified various provisional concerns with the cloud market, including a lack of viable competitors to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft, various barriers to switching or multi-using cloud providers or entering/growing in the market, and evidence that customer switching (and efforts to entice customer switching) is even more challenging in the context of Microsoft software customers using Microsoft cloud solutions.
The CMA's key recommendation is that it should use its DMCCA powers to consider SMS designation and subsequent remedies to resolve the concerns identified. The CMA's statutory deadline for a final decision is 4 August 2025, which suggests that the third SMS investigation trailed for 2025 will cover a different topic unless the CMA's cloud market investigation process is curtailed.
The growth agenda
In and amongst these developments, the Government has provided a strong steer that the CMA must focus on growth when choosing whether and how to enforce. The CMA's work in relation to digital markets is likely to be especially closely scrutinised because the regime is nascent and therefore unconfined by previous precedent, with any remedies proposal likely to generate strong policy arguments from both sides of the debate on so-called ""big tech"".
On 23 January, shortly after Marcus Bokkerink's dismissal and on the same day as the launch of its second SMS investigation, the CMA published a paper arguing that its digital markets regime can be used to drive growth by harnessing the benefits of investment and innovation by big tech firms while also ""expanding opportunities for investment and innovation by creating a level playing field for start-ups and scale-ups (many UK-based) to succeed"". The word ""growth"" appears multiple times in the CMA's press releases for both SMS investigations 8, and on 28 January the CMA also published terms of reference for a new CMA Growth and Investment Council which brings together key senior stakeholders from the business world to discuss how best to support innovation, investment and growth 9.
Final thoughts
2025 looks set to be a seminal year in the development of competition and consumer policy in relation to digital markets. The CMA has begun 2025 with extensive new powers but also a strong steer to be careful how it uses them. The ITCs published with respect to the CMA's two SMS investigations are, as with traditional market studies, likely to play a critical role in shaping the CMA's output and proposed remedies, and it is likely that both sides of this debate will seek to frame their arguments in terms of how best to support and stimulate growth in the UK economy. The CMA has chosen to prioritise two areas of the digital economy which were previously the subject of in-depth market studies for its first two SMS investigations. It has done so intentionally to build on prior work and also to ensure its early work is targeted at issues with maximum cross-sectoral impact; indeed, most businesses will have at least some reliance on online search engines, online advertising and online apps to get their products and services across to customers. Given this, the CMA's digital debut is set to be watched closely by a range of businesses, both in the UK and (given the cross-jurisdictional nature of digital businesses) overseas. It remains to be seen whether the CMA will move fast and break things with its new powers, or instead speak softly despite its rather large stick.

By Kimberley Kao
Apple has reached an investment agreement with Indonesia after protracted negotiations, which should clear the way for the sale of iPhone 16 handsets in Southeast Asia's largest economy.
Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita said in a media briefing on Wednesday in Jakarta that Apple's investment plan for the 2025-2028 period has been approved, according to a release posted on the ministry's website.
He added that the ministry will proceed to issue the license Apple needs to sell iPhone 16s in the country.
Apple agreed to increase its investments in Indonesia, including committing to establish a research and development center focused on software development, the ministry said.
Apple supplier Luxshare will invest $150 million at a facility in Batam that will manufacture accessories for AirTag tracking devices, the ministry said.
Additionally, Apple has committed to sourcing AirTag battery components from Indonesian manufacturers, and is also preparing a production line in Bandung to manufacture mesh fabric for AirPods Max, the ministry said.
Apple will also bring in $160 million in fresh cash investments.
Apple and Luxshare didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.
The sale of Apple's latest iPhone 16 handsets had been banned since October over what officials characterized as the company's nonfulfillment of local investment requirements. Apple executives had visited Indonesia in January to continue discussions to lift the ban.
The industry ministry had said a previous proposal by Apple to build a factory to produce AirTag products in Batam wasn't sufficient to fulfill requirements related to a policy aimed at supporting domestic industries and reducing dependence on imported products.
Under the policy, companies have to meet set requirements for using goods or services sourced from within Indonesia. This can be done via various means, including manufacturing products, building factories or developing innovations domestically.
The cellphone market in Southeast Asia's largest economy is a lucrative one, benefiting from a large, growing population with rising disposable incomes.
There are an estimated 354 million devices in active use in Indonesia, according to the ministry. That compares with a national population of about 270 million, according to World Bank estimates.

(Reuters) -     U.S. officials are examining whether the U.K. broke agreements between the two nations with a reported demand that Apple build a backdoor into its encrypted cloud storage systems.
Apple last week withdrew an encrypted storage feature or U.K. users after refusing to create a backdoor that would have allowed the government to access backups of photos and messages - including for users outside the U.K.
In a letter dated February 25 to two U.S. lawmakers, Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said that the U.S. is examining whether the demand broke a bilaterial agreement called the CLOUD Act that bars the U.K. from issuing demands for the data of U.S. citizens and vice versa.

LONDON (AP) — Apple is fixing a bug within the dictation feature on some iPhones that briefly suggests the word “Trump” when a word with an R consonant is spoken, including ""racist.""
The company is responding to the controversy after some iPhone owners posted videos on social media this week to detail how the glitch works.
When users activated the dictation feature and said the word “racist,” the word “Trump” appears in the text window before quickly being replaced by the correct word, according to various videos posted online.
“We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers Dictation and we are rolling out a fix today,” Apple said in a statement sent to The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The company said that the speech recognition models that power the voice-to-text feature might show words with some phonetic overlap.
It also said that other words that have an “r” consonant were also erroneously triggering the bug. The Associated Press could not duplicate the problem on Wednesday, a day after it emerged.
This week the company announced a plan to invest more than $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the United States over the next four years as well as build a new factory in Texas, amid Trump's threats to impose tariffs on imports. Separately, Apple shareholders rebuffed an attempt to pressure the company into joining Trump’s push to scrub corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce.

In a recent decision highlighting the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's growing concern with multiple petition practice, the PTAB has denied Apple's inter partes review petition challenging Smith Interface Technologies' patent, emphasizing that less can be more when it comes to IPR strategy.
The Board's February 13, 2025 decision in IPR2024-01086 rejected Apple's petition - one of seven parallel petitions filed against the same patent - marking a clear stance against what some practitioners call “petition flooding.”
“[I]n most situations, one petition is sufficient to challenge a patent's claims,” the Board emphasized, quoting its Trial Practice Guide. While acknowledging that multiple petitions might sometimes be necessary, the Board stressed that “this should be rare.”
Key Takeaway: The numbers matter. In this case, Apple challenged 91 unique claims across seven petitions targeting U.S. Patent No. 10,656,754, which covers technology for navigating between user interfaces. While the Board agreed that multiple petitions were warranted given the scope, it found seven to be excessive.
Apple's Argument Falls Flat
Apple attempted to justify its approach by arguing that word count limitations necessitated multiple filings. According to Apple's ranking notice, common sections across petitions “require[d] approximately 8,350 words,” leaving only “about 5,650 words per petition” for specific invalidity arguments.
The Board wasn't convinced. “Petitioner has not persuasively shown that so many words were actually required for these sections,” the decision stated, noting that “although we agree that the common sections needed to be repeated in each petition…we are not persuaded that the common sections required approximately 8,350 words.”
Notably, the Board pointed out that one of the three independent claims “is only fifteen lines long, and its technology is relatively simple, yet Petitioner's analysis of this claim stretches for seventeen pages.”
Strategic Implications
“We are persuaded that this group of cases is somewhat extraordinary and, consequently, that more than two petitions are justified,” the Board acknowledged, but ultimately concluded that “institution of three of the seven petitions is appropriate.”
The decision serves as a reminder that while the PTAB will accommodate legitimate needs for multiple petitions, practitioners must justify their approach and demonstrate efficient use of the Board's resources.
Final Impact
The Board's decision to consider only the top three ranked petitions of the seven filed and deny the rest - including this lowest-ranked petition - signals a continuing trend of managing the PTAB's docket through discretionary denials. This approach balances petitioners' rights to challenge patents with the Board's need to efficiently manage its resources.
For patent practitioners, the message is clear: when considering multiple petitions, make every word count and be prepared to justify the need for each additional petition. As this decision shows, more isn't always better in IPR practice.
Administrative Patent Judge Juliet Mitchell Dirba authored the decision, joined by Judges Nathan A. Engels and Sharon Fenick. Apple Inc. v. Smith Interface Technologies, LLC, Case No. IPR2024-01086, Paper 10 (PTAB Feb. 13, 2025).

(Reuters) -     Apple shareholders rejected a proposal against its diversity, equity and inclusion policies at an investor meeting on Tuesday, a major victory for the tech giant amid growing backlash against such initiatives in the United States.
The vote was a test of investor views about the value of DEI programs, which many companies added or beefed up starting in 2020 amid the Black Lives Matter movement.
Growing conservative pushback has led several large U.S. companies, including Meta, Alphabet and Amazon.com, to drop their DEI goals before and after Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency.
Apple shareholders also voted against an investor proposal asking the company to prepare assessing the risks of its work with artificial intelligence, while all management proposals were approved, a preliminary tally of the vote count showed.

Apple shareholders rebuffed an attempt to pressure the technology trendsetter into joining President Donald Trump's push to scrub corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce.
The proposal drafted by the National Center for Public Policy Research — a self-described conservative think tank — urged Apple to follow a litany of high-profile companies that have retreated from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the Trump administration's crosshairs.
After a brief presentation about the anti-DEI proposal, Apple announced shareholders had rejected it without disclosing the vote tally. The preliminary results will be outlined in a regulatory later Tuesday.
The shareholder vote came a month after the same group presented a similar proposal during Costco's annual meeting, only to have it overwhelmingly rejected. A similar outcome is expected during Apple's annual meeting despite the vocal objections of critics.
Just as Costco does, Apple has steadfastly stood behind diversity and inclusion efforts that its management contends make good business sense.
But the National Center for Public Policy Research's proposal has attacked Apple's diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. The group estimated about 50,000 Apple employees could file cases against Apple without detailing how it arrived at that figure.
“It’s clear that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,” the National Center for Public Policy Research says in its proposal.
The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against Target alleging the retailer's recently scaled-back DEI program alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of shareholders.
In its rebuttal to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple said its program is an integral part of a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current market value of $3.7 trillion — greater than any other business in the world.
“We believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apple’s success as making the best products in the world,” the company said in its statement against the proposal. “We seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.”
In its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple disclosed that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees were men.
Other major technology companies for years have reported employing mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs — a tendency that spurred the industry to pursue what have been largely unsuccessful efforts to diversify.

Apple,2025-02-25,Chinese phones dominate Southeast Asia—but it’s ‘now or never’ for these budget brands to go premium,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=592268a96f30233059fabf1840896614715441b45a38cd0aba44969746ea87cc,"As the smartphone market matures, Chinese brands like Oppo are looking for growth by selling better phones, instead of more phones.","Oops, something went wrong
China’s leading smartphone brands, after dominating the world’s budget segment, are rushing to go premium in search of growth.
In Southeast Asia, Apple and Samsung together make up more than 90% of the market for smartphones over $600, according to data from market intelligence firm Canalys. Yet “brands like Xiaomi, vivo, Oppo, and Transsion dominate the lower price segments,” Sheng Win Chow, a smartphone analyst at Canalys, says.
“Affordable and competitive pricing” is helping Chinese brands penetrate emerging markets—not just Southeast Asia, but also Africa and Latin America, notes Will Wong, senior research manager with IDC’s Asia-Pacific client devices group.
But he warns that after successfully amassing market share in more budget-friendly segments, “it’s now or never for Chinese brands to target the premium segment.”
“The global smartphone market has entered a mature stage that’s only expected to log low single digit growth in the long term,” Wong says. That means that Chinese brands will need to grow on the basis of selling better phones, rather than more phones.
And Southeast Asia presents a good opportunity for these budget brands to crack a premium market that’s long been Apple and Samsung’s playground. Both Wong and Chow point out that the region’s growing economy means a rising class of consumers keen to upgrade their devices.
Last week, Oppo, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer, launched its latest foldable smartphone at a launch event held at Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands casino.
The “Find N5,” priced at 2499 Singapore dollars ($1870), is clearly a premium product. The phone is a rival in terms of features and quality to Samsung’s Z6 foldable phone, released in October. For instance, Oppo boasted during its launch event that its Find N5 was thinner when folded and also offers better battery capacity.
Oppo is already Singapore’s third-most popular smartphone brand, says Billy Zhang, president of overseas marketing, sales and services. Singapore’s consumers, while small in number, have a high-level of disposable income and are open to trying new premium products, he adds.
Besides Singapore, Oppo is also one of the top brands in the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia, according to IDC. That makes Southeast Asia a “fortress” for Oppo, Wong says, and a good launchpad for the brand to break into the premium market.
“Oppo has been one of the key Chinese vendors that promptly brought the latest GenAI and foldable features to the market with competitive prices,” he adds.
Other leading Chinese smartphone makers are also expanding their presence outside their home market.
Last week, Huawei marked the international rollout of its trifold smartphone at an event in Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysia launch was the first consumer electronics event the company’s held outside of China since the U.S. slapped sanctions on it in 2019.
HONOR, formerly Huawei’s budget smartphone division, is also focusing on Southeast Asia, planning 10 “experience” stores selling mid-to-high-end products in Indonesia, according to the South China Morning Post. 
Apple, too, is trying to expand its consumer base. Last week, the company unveiled the iPhone 16e, the successor to the budget iPhone SE. Yet, at $599, Apple’s lower-end phone is still pricey, costing over $150 more than the iPhone SE. By comparison, Oppo’s Reno 13, one of the brand's latest higher-end smartphones, costs $597.

(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia and Apple Inc. have agreed on terms to lift the country’s ban on iPhone 16s, said people familiar with the matter, paving the way to end a five-month tug-of-war that forced the US tech giant to raise its promised investment in the country to $1 billion.

The Ministry for Industry, which is responsible for upholding the ban, is set to sign a memorandum of agreement with Apple as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the talks, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. A press briefing will also be held, the people said, adding the ministry intends to issue a permit allowing iPhone 16 sales as soon as possible.
The deal concludes a battle that started in October after Indonesia refused to issue a permit for the sale of Apple’s latest device, citing a failure to comply with domestic manufacturing requirements for smartphones and tablets. Apple then pledged to invest $1 billion in Indonesia, an offer President Prabowo Subianto directed his ministers to accept. However, the Ministry of Industry last month unexpectedly upheld the ban as it sought better terms.
On top of the $1 billion investment, Apple will commit to training locals in research and development on the company’s products so they can then develop similar software and design their own goods, the people said. The move is set to placate the government, which has been pushing Apple to set up R&D facilities in the country, they added.
The innovation investment will be done through programs other than the existing Apple academies, one of the people said.
Apple has no immediate plans to start making iPhones in the country, the people said.
While both sides have agreed to the terms of the ban being lifted, Indonesia has backtracked on decisions before and the deal could still fall through.
Apple and Indonesia’s Ministry of Industry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
While January’s last-minute scuppering of the deal came as a surprise, talks had continued to progress positively, the people said. Last week, industry minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita announced Apple had settled a $10 million debt to the government for not complying with local rules between 2020 to 2023.
Win for Prabowo
The deal is a win for Indonesia, with its hardball tactics paying off to get a major foreign company to invest more to develop its goods in the country and boost local manufacturing, instead of merely using the nation as a sales hub. The government had previously said that Apple had invested only about $95 million in Indonesia.
The agreement also comes at an opportune time for Prabowo. The optics of a US tech giant yielding to his administration could be used to boost his domestic standing, which has taken a hit following multiple policy U-turns that have generated confusion. On top of that, his plan for sweeping spending cuts that threatened jobs and scholarships triggered days of protests last week.
For Apple, the deal gives it access to Indonesia’s massive consumer market at a time when sales in China have slowed. Though Apple ranks outside the top five smartphone brands in Indonesia, the country’s population of 278 million people — more than half of whom are under the age of 44 and tech savvy — is too good an opportunity to miss.
Apple’s $1 billion offer includes setting up a plant on the island of Batam to produce AirTags, a device that allows users to track their luggage, pets or other belongings. The US company is bringing on board one of its significant suppliers, Luxshare Precision Industry Co. to operate the plant which will eventually account for 20% of global production of AirTags, Bloomberg News previously reported.
Part of the investment proposal will also go toward setting up a plant in Bandung, about three hours southeast of Jakarta, to make other types of accessories, as well as funding Apple academies which equip students with tech skills like coding.

AAPL


Apple shareholders on Tuesday are expected to reject an attempt to pressure the technology trendsetter into scrapping its corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce.
The proposal drafted by the National Center for Public Policy Research — a self-described conservative think tank — urges Apple to follow a litany of high-profile companies that have retreated from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump.
It comes a month after the same group presented a similar proposal during Costco's annual meeting, only to have it overwhelmingly rejected. A similar outcome is expected during Apple's annual meeting despite the strident objections of critics.
Just as Costco does, Apple has steadfastly stood behind diversity and inclusion efforts that its management contends good business sense.
But the National Center for Public Policy Research's proposal has attacked Apple's diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. The group estimated about 50,000 Apple employees could file cases against Apple without detailing how it arrived at that figure.
“It’s clear that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,” the National Center for Public Policy Research says in its proposal.
The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against Target alleging the retailer's recently scaled-back DEI program alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of shareholders.
In its rebuttal to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple said its program is an integral part of a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current market value of $3.7 trillion — greater than any other business in the world.
“We believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apple’s success as making the best products in the world,” the company said in its statement against the proposal. “We seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.”
In its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple disclosed nearly that three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees at that juncture were men.
Other major technology companies for years have reported employing mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs — a tendency that spurred the industry to pursue what have been largely unsuccessful efforts to diversify.

Philip Schiller, a long-time executive who helped develop the App Store, told US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers Monday he was “concerned” she would find that the new fee didn’t fulfill her 2021 directive that the iPhone maker expand payment options for consumers.
Apple is still fighting with Epic Games Inc. (EPGA.PVT) four and a half years after the maker of the popular Fortnite video game accused the technology giant of violating antitrust law by charging exorbitant fees at the App Store. After a trial Rogers concluded in 2021 that Apple hadn’t run afoul of federal laws, but she found that its policies prevent consumers from getting cheaper prices and ordered changes.
Epic contends Apple still hasn’t complied with her order, more than a year after the company exhausted appeals all the way to the US Supreme Court.
Early last year, Apple lowered the commission on some in-app payments from 30% to 27%. But app developers must pay separate payment processing charges that push their costs past 30%.
Was there “significant compliance risk because of the proximity to the 30% commission?” Gary Bornstein, a lawyer for Epic, asked Schiller in federal court in Oakland, California. “Yes,” Schiller replied.
Schiller testified last year that Apple believed it was complying with the judge’s 2021 order. “We are trying to enable what the law requires,” Schiller said in May.
Schiller said there were multiple people involved in the process, including Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He also said that he was concerned the commissions would create a more “antagonistic” relationship between the company and app developers.
An Apple spokesperson said that expressions of concern about charging a commission don’t indicate a lack of compliance.
At a hearing last year, Rogers voiced skepticism about the changes Apple made. “All this does is maintain the non-competitive environment that exists,” she said to Schiller at the time.
The dispute comes against the backdrop of law enforcement and regulatory action in the US and Europe. The Justice Department is suing Apple over a number of policies the government says is designed to give it monopoly power over the wide array of companies that rely on the iPhone to reach consumers.
Apple is also the target of multiple antitrust actions in the European Union and could be the first company to face a fine over a lack of compliance with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act. The company was also hit with a €1.8 billion ($1.88 billion) fine last year for abuses under the bloc’s traditional competition rules — involving music streaming.

Apple (AAPL) and its CEO, Tim Cook, announced plans to invest $500 billion in US operations over the next four years, which President Trump could leverage in his dealings with other chief executives.
Christoff & Co. CEO Niki Christoff joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss how Apple's latest developments could factor into the Trump administration's strategy.
""Tim Cook and Apple are at the very front edge of this, of making commitments and giving good headlines, and the president wants to move fast on the things that he has promised. And that is America first, including having American companies make things here,"" Christoff says.
The alignment between business success and the administration's goals creates a dynamic where companies are more inclined to cooperate. However, Christoff notes that not all CEO's share the same ideological views. ""I'd say people have described Tim Cook as 10% political and 90% business person, and I think that's right,"" she says.
I wonder, Nikki, if Trump, you know, he's hanging out there in Mar-a-Lago with another CEO, and he could say now, you know, listen, Tim Cook, he just announced 500 billion he's going to spend and invest here, uh, in the US for the next four years. I wonder, do you think it could be used by Trump as kind of leverage when he's talking to other execs? 
Absolutely. This administration loves to line everybody up and make them agree to different things. We just saw Microsoft as an investor in OpenAI and part of the Stargate Alliance, um, agree to a similarly sized investment in the United States. There's only so many companies that can go that far. But, you know, Tim Cook and and Apple are at the very front edge of this of making commitments and giving good headlines, and the president wants to move fast on the things that he has promised, and that is America first, including having American companies make things here. So, I am certain that that is a point of leverage with other conversations. 
Nikki, um, this Trump term feels very different from the last Trump term in a number of different ways. And one of them is that companies, um, seem more willing to work with the president. Is that defensive? Is that offensive? What do you think is driving it? And what, um, you know, are we seeing a disconnect? I mean, you talk to these companies. Are we seeing any kind of disconnect between these public facing announcements and what they're saying behind closed doors? 
This is a great question, and I don't think that you can lump all of the CEOs and the companies and executives together. You have people who appear to be more ideologically aligned with where President Trump and this administration is. I'd cite Mark Zuckerberg of Meta. And then you have people who are pure businessmen, right? Like the Jeff Bezoses of the world who, um, really doesn't need very much from this administration. And so, you have a spectrum where I'm not sure their ideology matches with their business imperatives. But all of them have businesses to run. I think the difference to your point is that in the first administration, things were extremely chaotic. They moved, uh, much more herky jerky throughout these first, you know, hundred days. That is not the case. They are moving at pace. They have an overwhelming majority in both Congress and in, uh, in the election results. And so, there appears to be a mandate. The president is moving fast, and they are, you know, they are jumping as as required, and that is part of their jobs. How they feel ideologically? I'd say it's people have described Tim Cook as 10%, uh, political and 90% business person, and I think that's right. 
Do you think, Nikki, you know, Trump, uh, he may talk tough, but do you think he would ever actually do anything to really go after big American tech, to jeopardize American tech in any meaningful way? Because if he did that, Nikki, he of course knows he might, you know, jeopardize the stock market. And this president watches the market very carefully. He uses the stock market as kind of report card on the administration's success or failure. 
Well, one definite boon to the technology industry with this administration is you have already the vice president going overseas to Europe and saying, ""You guys have been a drag on our companies."" Um, the the prior administration was brutal when it came to competition with Big Tech. I think we still might see some of that, but at the end of the day, President Trump sees himself as a business person, and he loves business success. So, no, I don't think he's actually going to kneecap American tech companies, but he does want them to show up and show some difference and give him some good headlines, which again, Apple has done this week. 
Regarding potential government interference within tech, Christoff asserts, “President Trump sees himself as a business person and he loves business success. So, no, I don’t think he’s actually going to kneecap American tech companies.”

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Longtime Apple executive Phil Schiller on Monday conceded he initially opposed fees that the iPhone maker charges for in app-transactions processed outside its own payment system because he feared violating a court-ordered mandate designed to create more competition.
Schiller, who oversees Apple's lucrative App Store for iPhones, made the admission during three hours of testimony in the same Oakland federal courtroom where he last appeared on the witness stand nearly nine months ago as part of a long-running legal battle with Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game.
Epic began the showdown four and half years ago when it first filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging that Apple had built an illegal monopoly around its popular App Store that makes billions of dollars annually from a then-exclusive payment system that collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app commerce.
Although U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected the monopoly claims, she ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options.
After spending more than two years trying to overturn Rogers' order paving the way for alternative payment links to appear in iPhone app, Apple exhausted all its appeals 13 months ago and finally opened the door for other options.
But Apple's solution still demands a 12% to 27% commission from on in-app transactions executive through alternative systems and erected other hurdles that Epic contends were designed to discourage switching to different options.
Gonzalez Rogers is now considering whether to hold Apple in contempt of court and order the Cupertino, California, company to make more drastic changes.
Since the judge began that process last May, she has expressed frustration with Schiller and other Apple witnesses about their hazy recollection about how they came up with the rules for app store's alternative payment system. Gonzalez Rogers' exasperation prompted her to delay the proceeding while another judge oversaw the wrangling over Apple's production of internal documents to provide further evidence about its decision-making process
Those additional records helped Epic lawyer Gary Bornstein refresh Schiller's memory about his initial reluctance to impose fees on in-app transactions outside of Apple's own payment systems.
“I had a question of whether we would be allowed to charge a commission,” Schiller said when asked about the views he expressed during meetings held in April 2023. “It was a question about what was allowed under the injunction” issued by Gonzalez Rogers.
Besides being worried the “compliance risk” posed by the fees on alternative payment options, Schiller said he also worried about “collection risk” because Apple would need to depend on app developers to transfer the money that the company said it was owed. With its internal payment system, Apple can simply take its cut of the transaction before sending the rest of money to the app developers.
“What happens if a developer doesn't pay and what is the process for that?” Schiller recalled about his initial reservations about requiring fees on alternative payment options. He also said he was worried about Apple's collection demands creating an antagonistic relationship with app developers that have traditionally been the company's allies.
But Schiller ultimately signed off on the commissions in January 2024 as part of a pricing committee that included Apple CEO Tim Cook and the company's chief financial officer at that time, Luca Maestri. During his testimony, Schiller also confirmed that Cook pushed for a warning screen informing consumers the potential security threats posed by alternative payment options.
The latest round of hearings in the ongoing tussle are scheduled to continue Tuesday and Wednesday. The other witnesses scheduled to testify include one of Schiller's top subordinates, Carson Oliver, who also testified last year.

Apple Fellow Phil Schiller, the executive in charge of leading the App Store, testified in court on Monday that he had originally raised concerns about the 27% commission the iPhone maker planned to charge app developers on any purchases made outside the App Store. In addition to being a potential compliance risk, he suggested that the fee would create an “antagonistic relationship” between Apple and developers and seemed to require Apple to have audit rights to check whether or not they owed Apple money for the transactions that took place outside the App Store.
Apple typically charges a 30% commission on in-app purchases, but the reduced fee of 27% was a result of the Epic Games-Apple ruling. In 2021, the court determined that although the tech giant was not a monopolist, it would have to stop blocking app developers from linking to other ways for customers to pay beyond Apple’s own in-app purchases (IAP).
Apple technically complied with the ruling by changing its App Store Guidelines to permit developers to link to their websites from their iOS and iPadOS apps to give customers an alternative way to pay.
However, Apple only reduced its commission by 3% for these purchases. 
At the time, Fortnite maker Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney called out Apple for “bad-faith” compliance, saying the tech company undermined the 2021 order from U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, which had granted developers the right to add buttons or links to other purchasing mechanisms in addition to Apple’s IAP.
Apple and Epic Games have since returned to federal court so Rogers could determine whether Apple violated her original order that forced the App Store to open to more competition.
According to Schiller’s testimony, he initially objected to commissions on these outside purchases. 
“… I had great concerns about the collections of funds from developers,” he said, specifically “the change in the role of the App Store to now an organization that needs to collect money from developers.”
He said he was worried about how the App Store would have to go after developers who didn’t pay the commissions, making it “some kind of a collection agency” that had “rules around how we handle nonpayment and whether ultimately it means we’re going to have to do audits of developers.”
Schiller said he worried about “how all of those things change the relationship between Apple and developers in a way I thought would be detrimental.”
The hearing has unearthed the extensive process Apple underwent while debating the merits of still charging a fee. With hosts of documents and emails, lawyers detailed the back-and-forth that took place internally at Apple as executives weighed different options regarding its compliance with the court’s order.
Despite the initial concerns Schiller raised, a pricing committee that included Apple CEO Tim Cook, former CFO Luca Maestri, and Apple’s legal team, alongside Schiller, ultimately decided to charge developers a commission on these outside purchases.
The company also decided the same 3% fee reduction would apply to developers in its Small Business Program, lowering their already reduced commission of 15% to 12% for transactions outside the App Store. 
Documents referenced in court indicated that Apple analyzed the financial impact on developers who chose to link out to their own websites. 
In one model, for example, Apple worked to determine how the “less seamless experience” of using a non-IAP method would lead customers to abandon their transactions. By modeling where this tipping point was, Apple was able to determine when the links would stop being an advantage to developers, which would push them back to using IAP.
Apple also found that more restrictive rules around the placement and formatting of the links themselves could reduce the number of apps that decided to implement these outside links. The company looked into the financial impact of excluding some other partners — like those in its video and news programs — from the new program.
The company weighed different options for when to charge commissions, too. At one time, it thought to charge its 27% fee on external purchases that took place within 72 hours of when the link was clicked. When the new guidelines went live, however, that time frame had been stretched to seven days.
Lawyers suggested Cook himself was involved with how the warning to App Store customers would appear, recommending an update to the text that appears when the external links were clicked. In one version, that link warned customers they were “no longer transacting with Apple.” Later, the link was updated to subtly suggest there could be privacy or security risks with purchases made on the web.
In another meeting about the commissions, people had also expressed concerns about Apple charging for web transactions. 
“This might be perceived like we’re trying to charge for what happens on the internet,” one of the notes from the meeting said.

U.S. stocks were mixed on Monday. Investors are turning their attention to Nvidia’s upcoming earnings — the first time the AI chipmaker is reporting results since a breakthrough by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sparked a selloff in Nvidia and other tech stocks last month.
By the end of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 0.08%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 lost 1.2% and 0.5%, respectively.
Here are stocks to watch today:
Apple (AAPL) stock edged up after the iPhone maker said Monday that it will invest $500 billion in the United States over the next four years, with a focus on supporting domestic manufacturing and AI.
It plans to open a 250,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in 2026 that will produce servers, hire thousands of workers across a variety of fields, and launch a new education initiative. Apple also said it was committed to expanding its data centers across the U.S.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) offloaded more equities last quarter, expanding its record cash reserves to $334 billion. Warren Buffett defended the size of the cash hoard in his annual letter , saying the majority of his investors’ money would always be invested in shares, mainly of American companies. The stock gained on Monday.
Microsoft (MSFT) shares fell slightly on Monday following an analyst report that the company canceled some U.S. data center leases, potentially signaling an oversupply of AI infrastructure.
On Friday, analysts at TD Cowen (TD-0.18%) said in a note that the tech giant had canceled leases worth “a couple of hundred megawatts,” or approximately two data centers worth of capacity.
Shares of athleticwear brand Nike (NKE) gained 5% to above $80 after Jefferies (JEF) upgraded its recommendation to “buy” from “hold” and increased its price target to $115 from $75, making the stock a “top pick” on anticipated improvements in profit margin and earnings per share.
Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as the AI chip powerhouse is set to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record for a U.S. company.
Palantir (PLTR) extended its decline on Monday following last week’s plunge that was driven by a new share sales initiative by the CEO and a media report of potential U.S. defense budget cuts. The stock is now about 30% down from its 2025 peak earlier this month.
Robinhood (HOOD) stocked gained on news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is dropping its investigation into the company’s crypto arm. The move comes just a few days after the financial watchdog dismissed the case against Coinbase.

Ricky Mulvey: Buffet's throwing a barbecue. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey joined today by Jason Moser. Jason, how is your long weekend, man?
Jason Moser: Ricky, you had me at barbecue, man. The weekend was great. It was Valentine's Day Friday, which is really nice. Happy Valentine's Day, everybody. Ricky, I hope you had a great one, too. Dan. You as well? It's nice. We're trekking through the winter here in Northern Virginia.
Ricky Mulvey: We're getting those nine degree days out here in Colorado. Having a podcast to keep me busy ain't so bad. Let's get into this Apple stuff because tomorrow, Apple is set to announce a new device. They haven't said what it is yet, but a lot of observers, including Bloomberg's Mark German, believe it to be a lower cost iPhone. The iPhone SE, which according to German's reporting, ""We'll have the company's first in house cellular modem chip, the A18 processor and Apple Intelligence, the home button will be replaced by Face ID in a USBC connector supplants the lightning port. Jason, anytime Apple is launching an iPhone, they need it to go well. What does Apple need from this launch tomorrow?
Jason Moser: I love all of the tech that you mentioned right there at the front. Because the meme that's out there I don't know if you've seen it and I'm sure most people have. It's the coffee mug, right, where the actual mug costs $500. But then the handle for the coffee mug costs an additional, I don't know, $1,000 or something like that. People are having a lot of fun with this one. We don't really know, but to me, what they need, honestly, they need something more than just a cheaper phone. They've been there and done that. Now, if this is the announcement that it is just a cheaper phone, I think it's going to be received with a collective sigh. That's not to say, I'm bearish on Apple.
I think Apple is an amazing company. I think what they've done has just been incredible. The technology they continue to produce is amazing. But I mean, this cheaper phone would rhyme with a lot of these other device launches, things like different size phones, different sized iPads, price points for everyone. It's just probably not as innovative as folks in the investing community might be looking for. But I guess we're going to have to wait and see.
Ricky Mulvey: That's why Apple is trying to figure out what's next as they look further out. You already know about the headset battle that they have with Meta. But Germans reporting that now the quieter competition is in robotics. Here's the two strategies as these companies go mono e mono, head to head. Meta's near term goal is to build basically the underlying software for robotics hardware makers. They want to be like the Android of your humanoid robots. Apple's trying a different tact because Jason, they like to keep everything in house. One of the ways they're going to do this for an at home robotics thing is I'm going to use my arm here, a tabletop device that's basically a robotic limb attached to an iPad.
What are your thoughts on these strategies? With the Apple one, I don't see how this tabletop device is solving a problem that really anyone has unless you're running around while you're on Zoom.
Jason Moser: I think that makes sense. It's in line with what Meta has been trying to do, particular you look at their AI strategy, for example, what they've been doing with their Llama models and whatnot. They're trying to kind of be the underlying software for people to create, whereas Apple operates in a little bit more of a walled garden, so to speak. The bigger opportunity here, a lot of this just reminds me of what Elon Musk said on Tesla's recent call here. He was talking about he thinks there's a path for Tesla to become worth more than the next top five companies combined. Now, he qualified that with saying, there's a very difficult path. It's not a done deal, but he could see it. But the key to that path was through autonomous vehicles and autonomous humanoid robots.
It doesn't surprise me to see Meta and Apple wanting to pivot in that same direction. Now, in regard to that Apple device, that robot iPad thing, I think you're right. I look at that and I think, This is really neat technology. It's amazing. Most of this technology, to me, it's all magic. It's just phenomenal but doesn't seem like it really solves a problem. It's like much of what they do these days, is just amazing technology, but it doesn't really solve a problem. It gives us a different way to do things, but that's not always necessarily so convenient. I think that's where Apple and others have been spinning their wheels for a bit. Now, on the flip side, I do think there are potential massive industrial applications here. I think about all of the work I've done over the past five or six years in regard to immersive technology, for example, and I think with immersive technology, a lot of the focus was on how is this going to impact the consumer us as the mass consumer. We're not quite there yet. The headset battles are still going on.
We're still trying to figure out exactly how we're supposed to use these things on a day to day basis, and the answer is not clear at all. But there are a lot of industrial implications that are already playing out right now. I think it's fair for investors to say, Look, there is a consumer side to this, but there's also an industrial side to this. Reminds me of the fire-foam that Amazon put out a while back. It seemed a dud from the get go, but you know they're going to learn some lessons from it. Maybe with Apple and this robot iPad device, maybe it's not something that really keys in on the mass consumer, but maybe they take some lessons from this, and it gives them some industrial opportunities that can make a difference down the road.
Ricky Mulvey: I think that's going to be the most clear with Meta, at least right now is they're looking into immersive tech, and a lot of investors have wondered, why are you spending so much on reality labs and studying how human hands move? They're spending billions of dollars on reality labs for this immersive tech for humans. But if you're studying it that closely, and then you can apply it to robotics, for the software, maybe eventually even the hardware of building humanoid robots, this might be the thing where ten years from now, Jason, we're looking at a case study of how a mistake became a billion dollar opportunity or whatever for Meta.
Jason Moser: I think that's a great point. There's no accident that all of these great companies are studying all of these phenomenal technologies. It's no accident that they're studying this stuff. You have to take that into consideration as well. There's something that will come from all of this. Granted, it might take a little time, but my suspicion is there will be some world changing stuff that eventually comes.
Ricky Mulvey: What's it going to take for you to get a humanoid robot in the Moser household? What's your bar for that?
Jason Moser: I don't even have a bar. I've thought about this before I love technology. Remember, I was one of the first to get an Alexa. I was just excited to see that technology, going back to that, what problem does it really solve? I just don't have any interest in some creepy robot skulking around my house at all hours, Ricky. I have a hard enough time trusting our cat isn't going to get off me in the middle of the night while I'm sleeping. Now, with that said, that's just me. I don't consider myself a proxy for what most people want. In fact, often I think I'm probably the opposite. But these are big ticket items, and I think that's something to keep in mind, as well.
Ricky Mulvey: You love cooking. Let's say there's something you don't love in the kitchen. Maybe it's peeling garlic. It gets stuck everywhere, as you're trying to chop it and mince it. You can outsource that now or soon to your humanoid robots showing up to your house.
Jason Moser: It's compelling.
Ricky Mulvey: Let's get into audience. We're coming off this wave of a big earnings week. Do you look at the war on cash? You think about payments companies and I wanted to look at a company that I own for selfish reasons, and that's Adyen, which is a behind the scenes payment processor for big companies. Think into it in Adobe. They're using audience technology to do their payment solutions. They report every half year is a European company. What they found is that revenue and processed volume grew by more than 20%. Adyen's investors sure were happy with these results. A lot happier than PayPal's investors were with PayPal's results. But as you dug into the earnings this morning, Jamo, what did you find?
Jason Moser: It seems to be on the right track in what is clearly a very competitive space. I like what Adyen does in focusing on trying to bring this singular solution to the payments industry. I like the fact that they focus on these big ticket customers because there's a lot of money that can be made there. Of course, you sacrifice a little bit there on pricing, but we'll have to see how that plays out. There's been a big question in regard to this company over the recent past years, just in regard to margins and intake rates. But I think the numbers, as you said, for the second half of 2024, very encouraging. Net revenue up 22% from a year ago, process volume up 22%. They noted that was actually 28% excluding a single large volume customer, but we're going to go with 22% Riky. Thought it was really great to see EBITA close to 570 million euros up 35% from a year ago. I thought this was, to me, what stood out, because this has been a big question over the last several quarters just in regard to that EBITA margin, EBITA margin came in there at 53%. That was compared to 48% from a year ago. Now, that was due to basically two things. We saw some strong top line growth with a scalable business, coupled with less hiring than they've seen in previous periods. They're becoming a little bit more efficient and they're making a little bit more with the money that they're making, which I think is encouraging.
Ricky Mulvey: There's one metric I want to get into because not all companies report this. I thought it was interesting to brag about this, Jason, but the shareholder letter is promoting that Adyen has a net promoter score of 66. Essentially, net promoter score is, how likely are you to recommend this business to a friend? If you think of companies like Amazon Prime, high net promoter score, or even Chewy, when they've reported that has been a pretty high net promoter score. Jason, 66, is that low? 66 seems low.
Jason Moser: [laughs] I know. Everybody asks, Is that good? Is that bad? It requires you to dig in there and understand a little bit about what the net promoter score actually is. To clarify, this net promoter score, the NPS, you're calculating this based on the answer to one key question, and it's using a 0-10 scale. How likely is it that you would recommend this particular brand to a friend or a colleague, and you can score it in one of three groups. Promoters are considered scoring 9-10, passives score 7-8, detractors score 0-6. Then ultimately the calculation is subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters, that ultimately yields the net promoter score. Now, that can range from a low and absolute low -100 to a perfect score of 100, which is really unheard of.
But I thought it was interesting to look this up the creators of the net promoter score, it's Bain & Company, and they suggest this framework where they say, a score above zero is good, a score above 20 is favorable, a score above 50 is excellent, and then a score above 80 is world class. We can see where Adyen is concerned. It seems like based on the numbers, they're not doing too bad.
Ricky Mulvey: We're going to negative 100. You think it'd be 0-100, but you start working in those negative numbers, it can get a little tricky, 66, it's actually good. Let's move on to our final story, which is another one from last week that we're picking up in this post President's Day, A segment. That's Berkshire. They released their buys and sells in the latest 13F statement. A closely watched SEC filing to see what Warren Buffett and his lieutenants Ted Wexler and Todd Combs are up to. Jason, this is what they're up to over the past quarter. They seem to be trimming, not seem to be. They are trimming their big banks holdings, Bank of America, Capital One, Citigroup. Meanwhile, looks like Buffett's throwing an outdoor barbecue. He's getting Domino's pizza. He's getting some beer with Constellation Brands, and what's a barbecue without a pool? He's grabbing some Pool Corp which does a lot of maintenance and services for pools. Let's start with the banks, though. What's going on with these banks numbers? Seems like Buffet's getting a little pessimistic on that.
Jason Moser: That could be the case. He's done very well with these holdings for the most part. I think that's something to keep in mind. This could be a testament that maybe they feel like the economy in the near term might be a little bit more challenged. The interest rate environment may be a little bit higher than perhaps they were thinking previously before. It's worth noting too. He's held Bank of America for some time, and has done very well with it. Trying to take some of those gains and be a little bit more productive with them makes a lot of sense. I wouldn't read too much into it, but, I mean, it is something to think about, for sure.
Ricky Mulvey: I want to look into these tea leaves. He wants to throw a party. He's doing pizza, beer, and pools. What's going on here?
Jason Moser: I love that. Pizza and beer, it's a great combo. I absolutely see the love for adding to Domino's. I mean, it's really a tremendous operator in its space. We know, obviously pizza. What Domino's does so well, they execute so well, not only on the delivery side but on the pickup side as well. Being an international business, I think, generally speaking, when you have that brand identity and you have the control over that company that they do, you can maintain some quality in regard to the end product, and that matters a lot.
In regard to Constellation, I think that really, to me, that strikes me as a big value play. Given how the company has performed over the last year or so when you look at the results, it's been very encouraging. They've been able to capitalize on Bud Lights misfortunes. Modelo Especial, has been performing very well. They noted they grew to pollutions there with that franchise over 3% last quarter, and it's upheld its position as the top share gainer in the US. Both companies pay very nice dividends, which I think is encouraging. Another interesting one it seems like a very Buffet-style investment. Hey, everybody loves Fools. It's big business. They're the leader in the space. The stock has had a very tough year, while it's worth noting, this is not one that lights the world on fire. A lot of the challenges we've seen have been in discretionary spend here recently, we'll just have to see how that plays out, but interesting picks.
Ricky Mulvey: For the stock investors looking at that, maybe looking to follow in Buffett's lead a little bit, are there any overall retail lessons for investors like you and me who are looking at what Berkshire is doing?
Jason Moser: For me, the perpetual lesson here is that it's always fascinating to see what smart and prudent investors are doing. But that doesn't mean you should necessarily be doing it too. There is a very big difference between what I'm personally trying to accomplish versus what they do. Of course, we're all trying to make money at the end of the day. But we're in very different boats, and we have very different goals. I think that's always just something to keep in mind is their actions, while interesting doesn't necessarily mean we need to mimic them because we need to take into consideration our ultimate goal as individual investors, as well.
Ricky Mulvey: Jason Moser, your actions always interesting to me. Thanks for being here. Appreciate your time and insight.

Ricky Mulvey: Up next, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp take on your questions about saving for kids and starting a 401k at your workplace.
Alison Southwick: Our first question comes from Vinny. Hi, Alison, and Bro. Thank you for your always excellent advice and perspective on preparing for retirement. Thanks, Vinny. Bro is going to take a victory lap. He's back. Vinny writes. My wife and I welcomed our first child and future Fool into our family over the weekend. Congrats, Vinny. That's awesome. We want to start investing on his behalf as soon as we can. We want to use the money for education and to set him up for the long term. You've covered at length the 529 and brokerage accounts options, but we have issues with all of them. We want to control our investments. We don't trust that the 529 funds converting to Roth IRA will stick. We don't want to give over control of a custodial account at 18 and would prefer if we could make the account tax-advantaged somehow. All that to say, we don't love our options. Can you please compare and contrast the plans and maybe jump into any plans, accounts that I'm missing here? Thanks.
Robert Brokamp: Well, Vinny first of all, congrats on the newborn child and the new adventure. It's going to be a lot of fun. Secondly, you say you want to use the money for education and to set your son up for the long term. Those are somewhat different goals, depending on how you define setting the kid up for the long term, but maybe we'll talk a little bit about that. Thirdly, frankly, none of these options are going to satisfy all your criteria. Let's just do a really quick lightning round of your options and the pros and cons, and you can decide which has the pros that most outweigh the cons for your situation. For saving for college, by far, the most popular option is the 529 plan. The pros, money grows tax-free, if used for qualified education accounts, very high contribution limits. It varies by state, but we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly deduction on the state income tax return. If it's opened and owned by the parent or grandparent, it's considered their asset, not the kids, and that's beneficial when it comes to applying for financial aid and any unused money can be transferred to any other eligible relatives or to a Roth IRA if certain conditions are met.
Now, you say you don't think that's going to last. I've not heard that it's going to be eliminated, but sure, it could possibly happen, and you definitely do have to meet the criteria. The account has to be open for 15 years. You can't move over money. It's been contributed over the last five years. There are definitely a lot of rules around that. Now, there are really only two main cons to the 529, and that is you can only invest in mutual funds. If you love stocks, you can't do that. The investments can only be changed twice a year. If you're a long-term investor, it's no big deal, but you don't have a lot of flexibility. But if you don't like that or if you're looking for other options, another option is the Coverdale Education Savings Account. The pro of the Coverdale is that you can invest in stocks, and like the 529, the withdrawals are tax-free if you use for qualified education expenses.
The downside is very low annual contribution limit, just $2,000. Although there's still time to make a contribution for 2024, you have until April 15th. You can't contribute if you earn above a certain amount of money that starts to phase out at $95,000 for singles, 190,000 if you're married, though you can get around that by gifting the money to somebody else, and then they make the contribution. With the Coverdale, the money must be used by age 30. It can be transferred to another relative, not to a Roth IRA. Let's talk about some other options that you touched on, as well. You could open a brokerage account owned by the kid. This is an UTMA or an UGMA. The main advantage is there's some tax advantages. There's a certain level of interest in capital gains and investment income that is tax-free to kids or taxed at a low rate. The downside, as you touched on, is the kid does get control at the age of majority. It depends on your state, but eventually they do get it, and you have to hope that they're responsible with it. It is considered an asset of the kid, which will have a more harmful effect on financial aid eligibility when they go to college.
Now, you could instead have a brokerage account that's owned by the parents. That way, you maintain control, and then you just gift the investments to your son when you think he's ready, and you can do it all at once or just gradually over time. It's your asset of the parent, so it does not have as much of an effect on financial eligibility. The downside is you will owe all the taxes on the investment income, capital gains, or whatever else is going on in that account for as long as you own it. Then the last thing I will highlight is the Roth IRA. This is the thing like, if you really want to set your son up for being financially secure in the long run, do a Roth IRA. It grows tax-free if left alone until age 59.5. You can take some money tax and penalty-free out beforehand for qualified higher education expenses. You can always take out the contributions tax and penalty-free for any reason, and then the withdrawals for higher education expenses will be free of the 10% early distribution penalty.
The downside is the kid has to have earned income. Unless your newborn is already working, they're probably not earning money. There are people who try to get creative with this, so maybe they have a business. They take a picture of their kid. They put it on their business website, and then they pay their kid a modeling fee. There's all funny ways that people try to get around it, but they do have to have earned income. Like the regular brokerage account, it is their money so they can control at the age of majority. All this to say, there's no perfect solution, but it's also not an either or decision. You could choose two or three or more of these options, and regardless of which you choose, your son is very lucky that you and your spouse are already thinking about his financial future. Just know that everything that I discussed here is just the basics. To learn more about all these options, especially when it comes to paying for college, visit savingforcollege.com.
Alison Southwick: Our next question comes from Brett. My question is about valuations, the price-to-earnings ratio or PE to be specific. I read an article some years back about investors being price-anchored to PE when they first started investing. If you look back 100 years or so, you'll see spikes above 20 were rare until the '90s. From then on, PE ratios continue to climb steadily. My question is, can PE ratios be affected by inflation? Like every other good whose price climbs, why wouldn't valuations be more expensive over time? Does that correlation stick?
Robert Brokamp: Well, Brett, I would say that the E in the PE, the earnings are definitely affected by inflation. Earnings are profits. Profits are what you charge for revenue minus the cost of doing whatever you do to make a business. If inflation is higher, the inputs into your business are higher, which could reduce earnings. On the other hand, if a company can increase the prices above the rate of inflation, then earnings will benefit. But inflation doesn't really explain why people are willing to pay more for earnings over the past few decades, which is the P and the PE ratio. But there are a few theories for why over the last 20 or 30 years, PEs have risen. One is that it's because interest rates have been really low, which can be good for stocks because loans are cheaper to the business, and there's not as much competition from cash and bonds. Interest rates have gone up over the past year or so, but they're still very low compared to what they were in the '80s and '70s.
Another possible reason suggested by Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel, is that investing is now easier and cheaper. You can invest with the click of a button and you don't have to work with a stock broker. Siegel says that commissions and bid-ask spreads used to reduce the returns as someone earned by 1-2% a year, whereas now transaction costs are virtually nothing, plus tax rates are lower now, so stocks deserve a higher premium, according to Siegel. Finally, there's just more demand for stocks, largely thanks to the popularization of 401ks and IRAs over the past 40 years. According to the Federal Reserve, less than 10% of households own stocks in the early 1980s compared to more than 50% today. There are plenty of possible reasons why PEs have mostly been higher in 2000, but it's not likely due to inflation.
Alison Southwick: Cat writes. Does a stock's price go down proportionately to cover a dividend payment, or is it just a reaction from the investing community?
Robert Brokamp: Well, I think the answer is both. The price does go down proportionally, but it's due to a reasonable price adjustment that is basically demanded by the investment community. When a company pays a dividend, it's essentially distributing one of its assets, in this case, cash. After the company distributes an asset worth millions of dollars, and in some case, hundreds of millions of dollars, the price of the stock should adjust because the company is no longer worth as much. Here's generally when you'll see it happen. When a company declares a dividend they will also declare a record date, which is when you have to be a shareholder of record to get the dividend. In most cases, the record date will also be the ex-dividend date, though sometimes ex-dividend date is a day before. You have to own the stock before the ex-dividend date to get the dividend.
That ex-dividend date is generally when you'll see most of the adjustment to the stock price because anyone who buys it on that date or later won't get the dividend. If the dividend is small, it may be hard to tell whether any of the price movements are due to payout or just regular market noise. But if it's a higher-yielding stock you're looking at or a higher-yielding fund, such as a bond fund, you'll see a much more noticeable price adjustment on that ex-dividend date.
Alison Southwick: Our next question comes from Jonathan. Hi, Alison and Bro. I've been a long time listener back when you had your own show. I even sent you a postcard at one point. Jonathan, I still have that postcard somewhere.
Robert Brokamp: I'm sure it is somewhere.
Alison Southwick: We have hundreds and hundreds of them from listeners. Thank you. Jonathan Writes, my mum passed away in 2023, and we, my sister and I sold her house in Arlington, Virginia in 2024. We hired a CPA to handle the taxes for the trust and the estate, and they told us that as the beneficiaries, we should expect to receive a K-1 form from both the estate and trust. What exactly is the K-1 form, and how will that affect my personal income taxes?
Robert Brokamp: There are a couple of versions of the K-1. A couple of those versions are for businesses, so that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about the K-1 that is specifically for estates and trusts. You can pull the form up on the Internet, and you'll see basically especially with the trust, you'll have a share of any of the income that is distributed by the trust. K-1 will say, how much of it is yours and how it should be categorized. If you look at the K-1 form, you'll see different lines for interest income, ordinary dividends, qualified dividend, short-term gains, long-term gains and then you basically take that information and put it on your income tax return when you file your taxes.
Generally speaking, there aren't that many taxes related to the estate because one of the jobs of an executor is to pay the estate's taxes before the money is distributed. But since your CPA said you might get something, keep an eye out for it. I would just say since you have any CPA, you might want to get help from that CPA to know where to enter the information on your tax return and if you use any tax prep software, you probably could do an online search for how they handle information you receive from a K-1.
Alison Southwick: The next question comes from Mason. My workplace, a nonprofit, does not offer a 401k. How have you seen workers effectively advocate for one? Who should I tell the director to go to in order to start one?
Robert Brokamp: I would say, the first thing to do is talk to the director about why they don't offer one. You want to understand what the limitation is. It might be just that they're not particularly savvy about investments or retirement or anything like that or benefits. A lot of small companies, a lot of small nonprofits are very good people who started their companies or nonprofits for good reasons, but they're actually not that aware of how to do all this. Just find out why they don't, and then explain why you want one. Why it's good for the organization. It's a retention tool. It keeps employees, attracts employees, and it's good for the director, too, if the director works for a nonprofit, and then knowing that criteria, maybe help doing some of the research.
Nonprofits are generally associated with 403(bs), but a few changes over the past couple of years have made it easier for nonprofits to have a 401k, so you don't have to limit yourself to the 403(b). If it comes down to cost and administrative overhead, perhaps the easiest choice might be what's called a non-ERISA 403(b). ERISA is E-R-I-S-A. It's referencing a law that was passed in 1974 that basically regulates retirement plans. By making it a non-ERISA 403(b) that'll be easier and cheaper to operate, but it has some drawbacks, such as there are not as much protections for the workers, and the employer can't offer a match, but it might be better than offering nothing.

Apple,2025-02-24,Corporate America dusts off a familiar playbook for Trump,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=dbf0bfe535e227316e7ffcb0f720153ae2eef48a4fb2f9e955781eaaf4926224,"President Donald Trump has adopted Silicon Valley’s mantra of “move fast and break things,” leaving uncertain companies grappling with a potentially expanding trade war, slews of executive orders, and no end of legal questions.","Oops, something went wrong
President Donald Trump has adopted Silicon Valley’s mantra of “move fast and break things,” leaving uncertain companies grappling with a potentially expanding trade war, slews of executive orders, and no end of legal questions.
The second administration will “bring about a new era of American governance, with new rules, new norms, and risks” Frontline Government Relations CEO Michael Glassner, a top 2024 Trump campaign adviser, said as he launched his new lobbying firm in January.
That already appears to be true. But major American companies are already largely sticking to old tricks from Trump’s first term to curry his favor — and influence his administration’s policy.
Executives at companies including General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F) have traveled to Washington to meet with trade groups and Republicans in Congress, while Airbus (AIR) and others are lobbying to support programs they care about. Trump’s inaugural committee broke fundraising records as companies sought his attention.
More than half a dozen firms — from Facebook parent Meta (META) to Coinbase (COIN) — have hired Trump loyalists as consultants or for their boards, as some did during the president’s first term. And lobbyists with connections to Trump have gotten plenty of new clients, Bloomberg News reports.
But it was Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday who showed why companies continue drawing from a well-worn playbook for a successful relationship with Trump.
During Trump’s first term, Cook managed to balance developing a good relationship with the president, even as he criticized some of his positions. The CEO built his goodwill with the president through focused one-on-one phone calls and meetings, close relationships with Trump’s family, and a willingness to let things slide, according to the Wall Street Journal.
“Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly,” Trump told reporters in 2019. “That’s why he’s a great executive because he calls me, and others don’t.”
After Trump issued the so-called “Muslim ban,” Apple (AAPL) joined a lawsuit opposing the action and Cook penned a memo criticizing the policy. But Trump continued to meet with Cook and mention him throughout his presidency, often labeling him a “great executive” and touting Apple’s investment plans, even if he got the details wrong.
That paid off in a big way in 2019 when Cook convinced Trump to give Apple an exemption from tariffs that impacted parts used in Mac Pro computers. After the exemption, Cook gifted Trump one of the first Mac Pros built at its new U.S. facility.
About six years later, Apple is staring down even more tariffs. Trump earlier this month slapped Chinese imports with 10% tariffs. Beijing retaliated with its own duties, as well as some actions against U.S. companies, including a potential investigation into Apple.
On Monday, a few days after meeting with Trump, Apple said it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the length of his term, with a focus on manufacturing. In a statement, Cook said Apple is bullish on American innovation.
Trump rushed to take credit, claiming that Apple wouldn’t invest even as little as 10 cents if it didn’t have faith in his administration. That may help Cook again secure Apple an exemption from Trump’s tariffs.
“We see this primarily as an attempt at earning a tariff exemption,” Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said over email, adding that “we think [Apple] is on the path to” earning another exemption from Trump’s tariffs, as it did in 2019.
Representatives for Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.
Apple’s stated investment — which Deepwater Asset Management estimates amounts to a roughly $20 billion increase in annual spending — is rivaled only by the $500 billion Stargate project backed by Microsoft (MSFT) and SoftBank, among others. Stargate, announced almost immediately after Trump took office, aims to develop infrastructure for OpenAI’s artificial intelligence over the next four years.
Both companies announced plans for facilities in Texas, a conservative-leaning state that has become home to a growing number of tech firms. Stargate’s data center campus was already being built ahead of the project’s unveiling at the White House.
Apple’s plans are similar to those announced during the prior two administrations. In January 2018, Apple said its “direct contribution to the U.S. economy” would be more than $350 billion over a five-year period, later “accelerating” its investments with a $430 billion commitment in early 2021, when Joe Biden was president.
Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described Apple’s announcement Monday as a strategic move that lets the company diversity its manufacturing, while also playing into Trump’s theme of U.S. investment, pointing to Stargate. Both Trump and Biden focused heavily on U.S. manufacturing on the campaign trail and throughout their time in office.
And in both cases, Apple offered large numbers for local and federal officials to tout, even if some projects were later put on hold — such as Apple’s planned campus in North Carolina that never materialized. Such announcements also tend to include previous agreements that companies spend on, such as purchases from suppliers, rather than direct investments.
“[T]hese cumulative numbers can include a lot,” Kerwin said, “and shouldn’t be viewed as fully incremental to existing operations.”

Apple,2025-02-24,"Apple to hire 20,000 people, invest $500 billion in the U.S. amid Trump tariffs",Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=66e7652a4166f45377131f527dc37b4c59503f8a2203f285bc7e083d45a7a118,Apple is among tech giants unveiling plans about how they plan to invest billions in the United States as they face potential tariffs and tech policy changes during President Trump's second term.,"Oops, something went wrong
Apple said Monday that it plans to invest $500 billion in the United States, hire 20,000 people and open a new manufacturing factory in Texas over the next four years.
“We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said in a statement.
The iPhone maker's announcement underscores how tech giants are trying to forge a closer relationship with President Trump as his second administration imposes new tariffs on China — where Apple manufactures its products — and shapes policies on artificial intelligence.
Apple's pledge to expand manufacturing in the U.S. came after Cook met with Trump last week. In a speech to governors in the White House, Trump said Apple was planning to ""build here instead because they don't want to pay the tariffs.""
Trump this month imposed a 10% tariff on imports from China. Citing concerns about illegal immigration and drug trafficking, he also announced tariffs against Canada and Mexico but then said they would be paused for 30 days.
Apple said workers at the factory in Texas will produce servers for Apple Intelligence, an AI system that can help people write, proofread text and complete other tasks. The 250,000-square-foot facility is expected to open in 2026 in Houston.
The 20,000 new jobs will mostly focus on research and development, silicon engineering, AI and machine learning, the Cupertino, Calif., company said.
It's also doubling its spending on a fund that supports advanced manufacturing and skills development to $10 billion from $5 billion. The company previously announced the U.S. advanced manufacturing fund during Trump's first term in 2017.
Apple said in addition to the plant in Houston, it plans to expand in other states including California, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, North Carolina and Washington.
Those expansion plans include investments in data centers, its facilities and skills development for students and workers. At a manufacturing facility in Arizona, Apple said, it will spend heavily to produce advanced silicon that is used in its devices. In Detroit, the company said, it's opening a manufacturing academy that will offer free courses online and in person. Apple engineers will team up with university experts to help small and medium-sized businesses implement AI and manufacturing methods.
Other leading tech companies also have touted new investments in the wake of Trump's election. Meta announced it was planning to build the world's longest undersea cable to expand high-speed internet access globally. In Trump's first week in office, OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank announced a $500-billion investment over four years in computing infrastructure to power AI.

Apple,2025-02-24,"Trump takes a victory lap on Apple’s $500 billion U.S. investment, but one analyst calls it ‘completely unrealistic’",Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3c7bba614996b811f92d359e4545d4a92e5d69687aed56d5c04f90643caeb4d2,"Another analyst said, “Cook continues to prove that he is 10% politician and 90% CEO,” referring to the Apple chief executive.","Oops, something went wrong
President Donald Trump thanked Apple chief executive Tim Cook after the company announced a $500 billion U.S. investment plan that would create 20,000 jobs. It not only helps Apple gain his favor via his “America First” agenda but could help it avoid tariffs. One analyst called it a smart move, while another thinks it’s unrealistic.
It didn’t take long for President Donald Trump to take his victory lap after Apple announced a plan to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. over the next four years.
“APPLE HAS JUST ANNOUNCED A RECORD 500 BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,” Trump posted to his social media platform. “THE REASON, FAITH IN WHAT WE ARE DOING, WITHOUT WHICH, THEY WOULDN'T BE INVESTING TEN CENTS. THANK YOU TIM COOK AND APPLE!!!”
The largest-ever spending commitment by Apple would expand its teams and facilities throughout the country and build a new factory in Texas that would advance its artificial intelligence push. “We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in a press release.
But in a note to investors, UBS analyst David Vogt said “call us a skeptic…we believe it lacks substance,” referring to the announcement and large headline figure, citing multiple reasons. For one, only 10% of Apple’s supply chain is in the U.S. while the rest is throughout Asia, he told Fortune—and it has probably taken the company close to a decade to make that 10% happen.
His note also points to other parts of the investment plan that don’t quite add up. He estimated that the addition of 20,000 employees would translate to just $5 billion in extra operating expenses per year.
Plus, Apple only spends about $10 billion a year on data-center capital expenditures, per the UBS note, and it only generates about $100 billion a year in free cash flow, of which $90 billion goes to share buybacks, he said.
Given that Apple’s current $10 billion in capex is just a fraction of the $125 billion a year that the new U.S. investment would require, Vogt questions where the additional money will come from, adding that he doesn’t believe Apple will slash its buybacks.
So $500 billion over the next four years is “completely unrealistic mechanically,” Vogt told Fortune, adding that “it’s unclear where the cash flow comes [from] to try to even remotely attempt this.”
Vogt would not comment on why Cook is making this move. But Apple has announced similar investments before: a $350 billion contribution to the U.S. economy in 2018 during Trump’s first term, and an acceleration of that amounting to $430 billion, which was announced in 2021 during the Biden administration.
Since his return to office, Trump has stressed an “America First” policy and has imposed tariffs on imports from China as evidence of such. Apple’s announcement not only cooperates with the president’s agenda but attempts to steer clear of his tariffs.
It comes days after Cook met with the president, and Trump claimed of Apple: “They’re going to build here instead because they don’t want to pay the tariffs.” Not to mention, the technology billionaire had a prime spot for Trump’s inauguration and reportedly personally donated $1 million for the event.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pointed out that Apple’s U.S. investment plan diversifies its manufacturing strategy and plays well into “Trump’s U.S. investment theme.”
“Cook continues to prove that he is 10% politician and 90% CEO and times like this he will be using his strong ties globally to make sure [it's] smoother waters for [Apple HQ in] Cupertino ahead despite the market agita around AAPL’s growth initiatives with Trump heading down the tariff threat path,” he wrote in a note.
He did not express overt skepticism about Apple’s announcement but said he did not view it as “a signal that Apple is tweaking its China manufacturing buildout.”
Apple did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

Apple (AAPL, Financials) plans to invest more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years, focusing on artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and manufacturing expansion, the company announced Monday.
The money will finance new manufacturing projects including a Texas facility and more R&D expenditure. Apple will also create a manufacturing school in Michigan to equip people in innovative manufacturing technologies and boost its U.S. Innovative Manufacturing Fund to $10 billion.
Apple will build a 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing plant in Houston as part of its development. Set to debut in 2026, the facility will generate servers for Apple Intelligence, a personal assistant powered by artificial intelligence. Previously produced outside the United States, the servers will run Apple's Private Cloud Compute mixing security architecture with artificial intelligence processing. Apple intends to additionally increase data center operations in Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina, Iowa, and Oregon.
Originally established in 2017, Apple's Advanced Manufacturing Fund will get an extra $5 billion in support. A substantial amount of this money will go toward supporting chip manufacture at Arizona's Fab 21 plant run by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM, Financials)
With more than 2,000 employees and starting mass-producing Apple chips last month, Apple is the biggest client at the facility. The company's suppliers run 24 chip manufacturing facilities spread across 12 states, therefore supporting its attempts at domestic manufacture.
With intentions to speed recruiting in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and silicon engineering, Apple's research and development investment in the United States has almost quadrupled over the previous five years. Over the next four years, the corporation wants to create 20,000 new positions in various sectors, therefore broadening its workforce among many states.
Apart from R&D development and production, Apple will set up a new manufacturing college in Detroit. Small- and medium-sized companies will be able to get smart manufacturing and artificial intelligence training at the facility. Designed with Michigan State University specialists, the program will comprise online and in-person courses emphasizing process improvement and project management.
Having paid $75 billion in federal taxes over the previous five yearsincluding $19 billion in 2024Apple claimed it remained among the biggest taxpayers in the United States.
Using direct employment, supplier relationships, and the iOS app economy, Apple's investment plan marks the most recent in a run of domestic growth initiatives employing 2.9 million people nationwide.

Shares of technology companies fell as traders continued to sell out of 2024 leaders.
The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund, which tracks the seven largest U.S. tech firms, is now down by almost 2% for 2025 so far, having risen by more than 30% during 2024.
Shares of Nvidia, which reports earnings later this week, fell 3% Monday and is down almost 6% for the year to date. The maker of chips for artificial-intelligence development will have even more investor attention on its earnings than previously. ""It'll be the first since DeepSeek became a household name,"" said J.D. Joyce, president of Houston financial advisory Joyce Wealth Management. ""Nvidia remains the posterchild for AI in general in my mind.""
Tesla is another major 2025 laggards, amid signs that Chief Executive Elon Musk has been distracted by his role in the Trump administration. IPhone maker Apple said it plans to spend more than $500 billion over the next four years, touting a mixture of new and existing initiatives that it said will expand its manufacturing footprint in the U.S. Apple is eager to stay out of the ""tariff crosshairs,"" said Joyce.
South African tech investor Prosus agreed to buy Anglo-Dutch food courier Just Eat Takeaway.com for $4.29 billion, using the war chest it built by selling part of its stake in Chinese Internet firm Tencent to bulk up its food-delivery arm.
In a good sign for AI investment, Anthropic is finalizing a $3.5 billion funding round that values the startup behind the chatbot Claude at $61.5 billion, showing how eager investors are to back promising AI companies despite the disruptive arrival of China's DeepSeek. Shares of AI software firm Palantir Technologies continued their recent rout and are now down by roughly 25% from highs earlier in February.

STORY: Apple said on Monday it would spend $500 billion in U.S. investments in the next four years.
The money will fund a giant factory in Texas for artificial intelligence servers and 20,000 research and development jobs across the country in that time.
It is also expected to cover spending on everything from purchases from U.S. suppliers to filming of television shows and movies for its Apple TV+ service.
Apple declined to say how much of the figure it was already planning to spend in the country.
The move comes after media reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook met President Donald Trump last week.
Many of Apple's products that are assembled in China could face 10% tariffs imposed by Trump earlier this month, though the iPhone maker had secured some waivers from China tariffs in the first Trump administration.
One analyst tells Reuters this is a political gesture toward the Trump administration.
Apple made a similar announcement about its U.S. spending plans in 2018, during the first Trump administration.
Trump, in a Truth Social post, thanked Apple and Cook, saying the move reflected the company's faith in his administration.

NEW YORK (AP) — Apple announced Monday that it plans to invest more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years, including plans to hire 20,000 people and build a new server factory in Texas.
The move comes just days after President Donald Trump said Apple CEO Tim Cook promised him that the tech giant’s manufacturing would shift from Mexico to the U.S. Trump noted the company was doing so to avoid paying tariffs. That pledge, coupled with Monday's investment commitment, came as Trump continues to threaten to impose tariffs that could drive up the cost of iPhones made in China.
“We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Cook said in a company blog post.
Apple outlined several concrete moves in its announcement, the most significant of which is the construction of a new factory in Houston — slated to open in 2026 — that will produce servers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features. The company claims this factory will create “thousands of jobs.”
The announcement is similar to one Apple made in early 2018 — during the first Trump administration — that promised to create 20,000 new jobs as part of a $350 billion spend in the U.S. Trump was also mulling a tariff then that could have affected iPhones at the time, but he didn't end up targeting those devices during his first administration.

Feb 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were set
to open higher on Monday, after a sharp selloff in the previous
week, while Apple dipped as the iPhone maker announced a $500
billion investment plan.
At 08:34 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 255
points, or 0.59%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 29.25 points,
or 0.49%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 95 points, or
0.44%.
Futures tracking the small-cap Russell 200 index
added 0.6%.
Most megacaps ticked higher in premarket trading, with
Alphabet up 1.9% and Meta adding 0.6%, while
Dow-listed financial stocks such as Goldman Sachs and
Visa gained about 0.9% each.
Chip stocks such as Nvidia and Micron
rose more than 1.6% each. Nvidia's quarterly results are
expected on Wednesday, putting semiconductor stocks in the
spotlight for the week.
The artificial intelligence bellwether's forecast is crucial
to investor mood on Wall Street, after the launch of low-cost AI
models from China's DeepSeek in January rattled tech stocks and
stoked doubts about U.S. dominance in the sector.
""(It will be) the company's first earnings report since
the January 27 DeepSeek-driven market selloff, when investors
started to raise serious questions about artificial intelligence
spending,"" said Clark Bellin, president and chief investment
officer at Bellwether Wealth in a note.


Apple slipped 0.8% after the iPhone maker
unveiled planned investments to help bring online a factory in
Texas by 2026 to build AI servers and add about 20,000 research
and development jobs across the U.S.
""(Apple is) moving into servers and that has not been the
area that they've succeeded in,"" said Kim Forrest, chief
investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
Futures edged up after U.S. stock indexes registered weekly
losses on Friday, as a batch of weak economic data and a
disappointing forecast from Walmart sparked concerns
that the world's largest economy was stalling. The benchmark S&P
500 and a smallcaps index marked their worst daily
declines of 2025.
On the data front, the Personal Consumption Expenditure
index - the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge - is
expected on Friday and could help markets gauge the timing of
the central bank's first rate cut this year.
Interest rate futures indicate the Fed will leave borrowing
costs unchanged for the first half of the year, according to
data compiled by LSEG.
Following Friday's soft data, markets will also be keen on
the Conference Board's report on consumer sentiment and the
second estimate on quarterly gross domestic product, due later
in the week. Remarks from at least nine Fed policymakers will
also be parsed.
Among others, Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares
rose 1% after the Warren Buffett-owned conglomerate reported a
record annual profit over the weekend.
Nike added 2.5% after Jefferies raised its rating on
the athletic apparel maker to ""buy"" from ""hold"", while Domino's
Pizza fell 4.8% after the pizza chain missed
expectations for fourth-quarter same-store sales.
Markets are also on edge for any tariff comments from U.S.
President Donald Trump, with his one-month reprieve on Mexican
and Canadian tariffs nearing its end.

By Dean Seal
Apple said it plans to spend more than $500 billion over the next four years to expand its manufacturing footprint in the U.S.
The iPhone maker pledged Monday to hire around 20,000 people during that time span and build a new factory in Houston that will create thousands of jobs.
The new 250,000-square-foot factory is slated to open in 2026 and produce servers supporting Apple Intelligence, the company's generative-AI system.
Most of the incoming wave of workers will be focused on research and development, silicon engineering, software development and AI and machine learning, Apple said.
The company said it also plans to create an academy in Michigan to train the next wave of U.S. manufacturers, and to double its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which was formed in 2017 to invest in U.S. companies that do advanced manufacturing, to $10 billion.
""We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we're proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook said.
The fund's expansion includes a multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon in a TSMC fabrication facility in Arizona, of which Apple is already the largest customer. Mass production of Apple chips began there last month, the company said.
While it is still largely dependent on East Asia, and China in particular, the Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple has been using more suppliers that manufacture in the U.S. since the pandemic.

Teams and facilities to expand in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington


Plans include a new factory in Texas, doubling the U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, a manufacturing academy, and accelerated investments in AI and silicon engineering
Apple® today announced its largest-ever spend commitment, with plans to spend and invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. This new pledge builds on Apple’s long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing, and will support a wide range of initiatives that focus on artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and skills development for students and workers across the country.
“We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “From doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we’re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we’ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.”
As part of this package of U.S. investments, Apple and partners will open a new advanced manufacturing facility in Houston to produce servers that support Apple Intelligence™, the personal intelligence system that helps users write, express themselves, and get things done. Apple will also double its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, create an academy in Michigan to train the next generation of U.S. manufacturers, and grow its research and development investments in the U.S. to support cutting-edge fields like silicon engineering.
The $500 billion commitment includes Apple’s work with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states, direct employment, Apple Intelligence infrastructure and data centers, corporate facilities, and Apple TV+® productions in 20 states. Apple remains one of the largest U.S. taxpayers, having paid more than $75 billion in U.S. taxes over the past five years, including $19 billion in 2024 alone.
Today, Apple supports more than 2.9 million jobs across the country through direct employment, work with U.S.-based suppliers and manufacturers, and developer jobs in the thriving iOS app economy.
Opening a New Manufacturing Facility in Houston
As part of its new U.S. investments, Apple will work with manufacturing partners to begin production of servers in Houston later this year. A 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility, slated to open in 2026, will create thousands of jobs.
Previously manufactured outside the U.S., the servers that will soon be assembled in Houston play a key role in powering Apple Intelligence, and are the foundation of Private Cloud Compute, which combines powerful AI processing with the most advanced security architecture ever deployed at scale for AI cloud computing. The servers bring together years of R&D by Apple engineers, and deliver the industry-leading security and performance of Apple silicon to the data center.
Teams at Apple designed the servers to be incredibly energy efficient, reducing the energy demands of Apple data centers — which already run on 100 percent renewable energy. As Apple brings Apple Intelligence to customers across the U.S., it also plans to continue expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada.
Doubling Apple’s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund
As part of this new investment, Apple is doubling its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which was created in 2017 to support world-class innovation and high-skilled manufacturing jobs across America. The growing commitment will increase the fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, focused on promoting advanced manufacturing and skills development throughout the country.
The fund’s expansion includes a multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon in TSMC’s Fab 21 facility in Arizona. Apple is the largest customer at this state-of-the-art facility, which employs more than 2,000 workers to manufacture the chips in the United States. Mass production of Apple chips began last month.
Silicon used by Apple is designed to bring Apple users incredible features, performance, and power efficiency across their devices. Apple’s suppliers already manufacture silicon in 24 factories across 12 states, including Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, and Utah. The company’s investments in the sector help create thousands of high-paying jobs across the country at U.S. companies like Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Skyworks, and Qorvo.
To date, Apple’s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund has supported projects in 13 states — including Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Indiana — that have helped build local businesses, train workers, and create a wide range of innovative manufacturing processes and materials for Apple products.
Growing R&D Investments Across the U.S.
Apple continues to expand its R&D across the U.S. In the past five years, Apple has nearly doubled its U.S.-based advanced R&D spend, and it will continue to accelerate its growth.
Recently, Apple announced the newest addition to its iPhone® lineup, iPhone 16e. iPhone 16e delivers fast, smooth performance and breakthrough battery life, thanks to the industry-leading efficiency of the A18 chip and the new Apple C1 — the first cellular modem designed by Apple, and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone. Apple C1 adds a new chapter to the story of Apple silicon and is the result of years of R&D investment, bringing together the work of thousands of engineers. Apple C1 is the start of a long-term strategy that will allow Apple to innovate and optimize the modem system for additional Apple products.
In the next four years, Apple plans to hire around 20,000 people, of which the vast majority will be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning. The expanded commitment includes significant investment in Apple’s R&D hubs across the country. This includes growing teams across the U.S. focused on areas including custom silicon, hardware engineering, software development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
Supporting American Businesses with a New Manufacturing Academy in Detroit
To help companies transition to advanced manufacturing, Apple will open the Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. Apple engineers, along with experts from top universities such as Michigan State, will consult with small- and medium-sized businesses on implementing AI and smart manufacturing techniques. The academy will also offer free in-person and online courses, with a skills development curriculum that teaches workers vital skills like project management and manufacturing process optimization. The courses will help drive productivity, efficiency, and quality in companies’ supply chains.
Apple has long been committed to investing in education and skills development for American workers and students. That includes ongoing and expanding grant programs for organizations like 4-H, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and FIRST, which work closely with Apple in communities across the country to create free programming that helps young people learn vital skills like coding.
Apple’s support for the next generation of innovators also includes efforts like the company’s New Silicon Initiative, which prepares students for careers in hardware engineering and silicon chip design. Last year, this program expanded to students at Georgia Tech, and it now reaches students at eight schools across the country. Apple is continuing to expand the initiative, including a new collaboration with UCLA’s Center for Education of Microchip Designers (CEMiD) beginning this year.

Shares of technology companies fell as traders retreated from high-risk momentum sectors due to rising volatility.
""I think it's big deal that we're losing our leader,"" said Jim Paulsen, who now publishes an independent newsletter. ""The Magnificent Seven are down year-to-date and underperforming on a relative basis for the last four months...it's hard for me to believe we're going to change [market] leadership without any bumps in the road.""
The CBOE volatility index, or VIX, also known as the stock market's fear gauge because it measures the premium paid for protective options, shot up by 18%.
Apple removed its Advanced Data Protection feature in the U.K. after the government reportedly requested access to user data stored on its iCloud service.
""While we remain positive on global equities supported by resilient US growth and AI tailwinds, a smooth journey up is unlikely,"" said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer of global equities at money manager UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note to clients.

UPDATE
Apple Intelligence on iPhone, iPad, and Mac expands to more languages and regions in April
Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence, will soon be available in more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) - as well as localized English for Singapore and India.
These new languages will be accessible in nearly all regions around the world with the release of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 in April, and developers can start to test these releases today.
With the upcoming software updates, iPhone and iPad users in the EU will have access to Apple Intelligence features for the first time, and Apple Intelligence will expand to a new platform in U.S. English with Apple Vision Pro - helping users communicate, collaborate, and express themselves in entirely new ways.
Apple Intelligence marks an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI and is designed to protect users' privacy at every step. It starts with on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power Apple Intelligence run entirely on the device. For requests that require access to larger models, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence.
Apple Intelligence will continue to expand with new features in the coming months, including more capabilities for Siri.

LONDON (AP) — Apple said Friday it will stop offering an advanced data security option for British users after the government reportedly demanded that the company provide backdoor access for any data those users have stored in the cloud.
The iPhone maker said its Advanced Data Protection encryption feature is no longer available for new users in the United Kingdom and will eventually be disabled for existing users.
Advanced Data Protection, which Apple started rolling out at the end of 2022, is an opt-in feature that protects iCloud files, photos, notes and other data with end-to-end encryption when they're stored in the cloud.
British security officials demanded in a secret order that the U.S. tech giant create so-called backdoor access so that they could view fully encrypted material, The Washington Post reported earlier this month, citing anonymous sources.
Apple “can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection” in the U.K., the company said in a statement.
“We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,” Apple said, without referring to the government demand.
The Washington Post report said the British government served Apple with what's known as a “technical capability notice"" ordering it to provide the access under a sweeping law called the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which has been dubbed the snoopers' charter.
The law officially gives British spies the ability to hack into devices and harvest vast amounts of bulk online data, much of it from outside the U.K. It contains provisions to compel companies to remove encryption to allow for electronic eavesdropping, while making it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has issued such demands.
“We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,"" the U.K. Home Office said in a brief statement.
Apple did not reveal how many users in Britain have been using Advanced Data Protection. It said the feature would still be available to users in the rest of the world.
Some types of data will still be end-to-end encrypted in the U.K. by default, Apple said, including passwords on the iCloud Keychain, information on the Health app, and communications on services including iMessage and FaceTime.
End-to-end encryption means that messages are scrambled so that only the sender and recipient can see them. If anyone else intercepts the message, all they will see is a garble that can’t be unscrambled without the key.
The episode illustrates “one of the fundamental flaws in government efforts to undermine encryption,"" said Mike Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. Faced with having to choose between security and complying with government regulations, companies like Apple tend to remove security features entirely, said Chapple, a former computer scientist at the National Security Agency.
“The net effect is reduced security for everyone. If other governments follow the UK’s lead, we risk a future where strong encryption is functionally outlawed, which puts all of us at risk not just to government surveillance but also to eavesdropping by other bad actors.”

AAPL

Following the launch of the CMA's first round of Strategic Market Status investigations into Apple and Google, we take a look at the nature of the concerns the CMA is investigating and consider what its announcements to date tell us about the way in which it intends to operate the new digital markets competition regime.
Introduction
With the entry into force of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA) on 1 January 2025, the CMA can designate large tech firms as having ""Strategic Market Status"" (SMS) when those firms hold ""substantial and entrenched market power"" and occupy a ""position of strategic significance"" in in relation to one or more digital activities. Once designated, the CMA can impose ""conduct requirements"" (CRs) on those firms, and/or introduce ""pro-competition interventions"" (PCIs) to address the root causes of their market power and ensure that digital markets are open to competition and achieve positive outcomes for UK consumers and businesses.
As discussed in our previous article, earlier this year the CMA gave a strong indication of how it intends to deploy its new powers in practice. This came in the form of detailed Guidance and a statement on the expected sequencing of its initial rounds of SMS investigations.
Since then, we have, as expected, had two rounds of announcements of SMS investigations from the CMA: the first into Google's search business; and the second, two weeks later, into Google and Apple's mobile ecosystems. These were accompanied by public Investigation Notices addressed to Google and Apple, setting out the CMA's grounds for believing the SMS criteria may be met, and by detailed Invitations to Comment (ITC) for the benefit of third-party stakeholders.
The investigations
General search services
The first SMS investigation, launched on 14 January 2025, targets Google's ""general search and search advertising services"". These comprise two distinct sets of products:
The CMA notes that these distinct activities are carried out in combination for the common purpose of operating Google's general search engine, which can be viewed as a two-sided platform that offers free general search services to users, financed through the sale of search advertising to businesses. The CMA therefore considers that these services may be grouped together as a single ""digital activity"" under the DMCCA for the purposes of designating Google as having SMS.
The CMA's investigation will therefore assess the extent of competition between Google and its rivals on both the user and advertiser sides of the market, and seek to identify barriers to entry and expansion. The CMA will also explore potential interventions to promote competition and reduce those barriers, and prevent Google from leveraging its market power in search into other services and/or engaging in conduct that exploits users and advertisers. These could include CRs ensuring challenger search services can access key default positions on Google's search engine results page (SERP), forcing Google to make key data available to competitors, and restricting Google's ability to share user data across its different services.
Mobile ecosystems
The CMA's second and third investigations, jointly announced on 23 January 2025, examine whether Apple and Google should be designated with SMS in relation to their mobile ecosystems, covering the provision of:
The CMA considers that these three digital activities may be carried out in combination for the purpose of facilitating interactions between mobile device users and providers of digital content (in the form of mobile apps and web content). Accordingly, the CMA is, as part of its ITC, seeking views on whether there should be a grouped designation, with a 'mobile ecosystem' constituting a single digital activity.
The SMS investigations will assess the extent of Apple and Google's market power and the potential competitive constraints they face in respect of these activities, including the presence of barriers to entry and expansion, competitive dynamics between the iOS and Android operating systems, and the influence of Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store on app design and distribution.
The CMA will also examine how the role and design of mobile browsers and browser engines - particularly Apple's Safari and WebKit, and Google's Chrome and Blink - shape user access to online content and services, including web apps (which can provide some of the same functionality as ""native"" apps, but run via a mobile browser), and how the configuration of iOS/Android impacts on the competitive landscape for mobile browsers and browser engines.
In parallel, the CMA will explore potential CRs to address issues arising from such market power. These are likely to focus on practices at the operating system level that impact competition at the browser and/or app store level (which is perhaps also why the CMA is considering whether 'mobile ecosystem' should be the relevant digital activity). Other interventions could include measures to promote switching between iOS and Android devices, forcing Apple and Google to allow alternative app stores and payment methods, and fair and transparent app review processes.
Key takeaways
The investigations are at a very early stage, but the CMA's announcements (which, whilst not as voluminous as a typical market study Statement of Scope, provide a lot more detail than announcements of antitrust investigations) already provide an indication of what lies in store and how the CMA is likely to wield its powers under the new regime.
Unfinished business?
One immediate observation is that the CMA, through these new interventions, is finally seeking to address concerns it identified some time ago in previous investigations, notably its:
For the CMA, a chief advantage of taking remedial action under its new powers is the possibility of ensuring that the concerns it has identified across a range of markets are addressed more holistically, taking into account the links and inter-dependencies between different underlying digital services and products. Additionally, the new regime is inherently forward-looking and iterative, allowing the CMA to refine its interventions over time to keep pace with technological and market developments and address possible circumvention by designated firms.
Are findings of SMS a foregone conclusion?
In each of the above-mentioned market studies/investigations, which it intends to draw upon, the CMA concluded that Apple and/or Google enjoyed significant market power in respect of the products under scrutiny (in some, the CMA described that market power as being ""substantial and entrenched"") or had reasonable grounds to suspect that they were dominant.
Consequently, while the CMA has reiterated that the outcomes of the SMS investigations have not been pre-judged, and that the qualitative legal test for a finding of SMS is distinct from any similar concepts under competition law, Apple and Google will face an uphill battle to convince the CMA that they do not benefit from substantial and entrenched market power and a position of strategic significance.
The CMA will, however, still have to establish that the position has not materially shifted since the findings of its previous investigations were reached, up to five years ago, and that there is nothing to suggest that the position will shift in the next five years.
Front-loading remedy design
A key element of the CMA's pronouncements around the turn of the year (including the revisions incorporated in its final Guidance document) was its aim to impose CRs at the same time as designating the first SMS firms, or very shortly thereafter.
The recent investigation announcements further emphasise this aim. Indeed, the relevant CMA case pages make clear that the CR imposition process set out in the Guidance, including the various consultative steps therein, is being carried out in parallel with the SMS designation process, following the same administrative timetable.
We can, therefore, expect a large part of the present investigations to focus on identifying, designing and consulting upon appropriate CRs, with initial draft CRs to be published in June 2025. Again, the CMA will here be able to draw on its previous work, including the extensive work carried out on remedies as part of the MBMI. But this will still be a substantial undertaking, given the range of products in scope of the investigations (each of which could require multiple CRs) and the diverging stakeholder interests the CMA will need to grapple with.
A flexible and forward-looking regime
The first wave of SMS investigations illustrates the inherent flexibility of the UK's digital markets competition regime.
Most notably, the CMA has been quick to deploy its ability to group distinct activities into one digital activity for SMS investigation purposes - something that is not possible under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is based on a more rigid framework, where each core platform service must be assessed and designated separately. To group the activities in this way, the CMA will need to establish that the relevant legal test (i.e. that the activities have a substantially similar purpose, or can be carried out in combination for a specific purpose) is met.
The main motivators for the CMA in seeking to group activities in this way appear to be a desire to: (i) look at the various activities holistically through one investigation (taking into account the interplay between the various components of the SMS firms' ecosystems); and (ii) move quickly in imposing CRs that address concerns across multiple markets, in a way that is administratively manageable.
Another element that comes to the fore in the ITCs is the forward-looking nature of the assessment the CMA intends to carry out. Not only is this required by the SMS criteria (as for substantial market power to be ""entrenched"", the CMA must consider the competitive position over the next five years), but the CMA also appears to be looking to identify CRs that can prevent harms that have not yet arisen. This is particularly evident in its focus on the competition that generative AI services and AI interfaces might be able to provide in online search, as these nascent technologies continue to mature at pace.
Here again a contrast can be drawn with traditional antitrust enforcement, which focuses on existing harms and/or conduct, and with the DMA's more rigid rulebook, under which the conduct obligations address known and present concerns and can only be modified by the Commission after a detailed market investigation and subject to certain pre-defined parameters.
The CMA will no doubt hope that, by anticipating future market dynamics, it can implement proactive measures to foster competition and protect consumers and businesses over the coming years of continued technological development. What remains to be seen is the extent to which this results in the CMA's CRs supplementing and/or diverging from the DMA's conduct obligations, the impact such additional regulatory layer and/or potential divergence may have on market outcomes, and also whether the CMA will be as quick as the Commission to investigate alleged non-compliance with such requirements.
What next?
Over the next few months, the CMA will focus on evidence-gathering, through the submission of information requests to, and by holding roundtables and bilateral meetings with, the potential SMS firms and relevant third parties.
The CMA will then publicly consult upon its proposed SMS designation decisions and CRs in July 2025. This will allow the CMA to consider the representations and feedback it receives in response to the consultation, as well as conduct further evidence-gathering, ahead of the statutory deadline for SMS designation in October 2025 (the CMA can unilaterally extend this deadline by three months if it considers it has ""special reasons"" to do so).
We can also expect the CMA to announce at least one more SMS investigation towards the middle of the year.
The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

Apple yesterday introduced the latest iPhone in the iPhone 16 series. It has become the iPhone 16e. This new model replaces the affordable iPhone SE. It is quite a bit cheaper than the most affordable iPhone 16, but at the same time more expensive than the previous iPhone SE budget models.
Key Takeaways
Yesterday, Apple presented their new iPhone 16e. This new model thus enters the iPhone 16 series. The iPhone 16e has a price tag of 719 euros (128GB). This makes it a lot cheaper than the cheapest model in the iPhone 16 series (from 969 euros), but it is more expensive than the previous iPhone SE budget models (in 2022: 529 euros). ""The competitive price of this new addition puts iPhone within reach of even more people,"" Kaiann Drance, Vice President of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing at Apple, said in the press release. The new iPhone replaces the iPhone SE, which until now has been the cheapest model of all iPhones.
Created for Apple Intelligence
The phone will be available for sale in two colors and you can choose from 128-, 256- or 512-gigabyte storage capacities. The fingerprint scanner has been replaced by facial recognition. Charging is now done via a USB-C cable. We find only one camera at the back of the iPhone 16e. So there are no cameras inside specifically made for zooming or taking landscape photos. You can charge the phone wirelessly, but there is no MagSafe, the system for magnetically connecting the wireless charger and other accessories to the phone.
""The iPhone 16e is made for Apple Intelligence, which enables all sorts of nifty new things on your iPhone,"" Apple reports in their press release. ""ChatGPT is integrated into Siri and Writing Help, so you can have even more expertise at your fingertips without having to switch tools.""
End of speculation
With this announcement of the new iPhone, speculation can end. For months there was speculation about what Apple would launch on Feb. 19, 2025. Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook sprinkled some more oil on the fire. The Apple boss announced on X that a new product was going to be presented on Feb. 19. This caused speculation to skyrocket. Many people already thought there was going to be a successor to the iPhone SE. Only it was not clear what it would be called.
Cook cited in his X post that people should get ready for ""the newest member of the family."" By this he was referring, according to many people, to the iPhone 16 family. After a long time of uncertainty, there is now clarity. The iPhone 16e will go on sale Feb. 28.

The company reported revenue of 280.15 billion yuan ($38.58 billion) for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with the 279.34 billion yuan expected by 17 analysts polled by LSEG.

Copyright © Emerce 2023
As expected, Apple today announced the iPhone 16e, a new addition to the iPhone 16 series. It is also Apple's first budget Apple Intelligence-capable device thanks to its A18 chip.
The iPhone 16e is splash, water and dust resistant and meets resistance standard IP68. The Ceramic Shield glass on the front is stronger than any other smartphone glass, according to Apple.
The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display with OLED technology runs edge-to-edge. iPhone 16e also has the very best battery life for an iPhone of this size: the battery lasts up to 6 hours longer than that of iPhone 11 and up to 12 hours longer than that of all iPhone SE models. The TrueDepth camera system also enables Face ID, for securely unlocking your iPhone, making purchases or logging into apps.
The CPU has 6 cores and is up to 80 percent faster than iPhone 11's A13 Bionic chip. Also new is the C1, the first modem developed by Apple itself. This is also immediately the most energy-efficient modem yet in an iPhone.
The powerful 2-in-1 camera system on iPhone 16e captures small and big moments, according to Apple. The 48-MP Fusion camera uses computational photography to capture super-high-resolution photos in which light and detail are ""beautifully balanced. The TrueDepth front-facing autofocus camera should guarantee sharper close-ups and beautiful group selfies. The latest generation of HDR accurately captures the subject and background, with natural skin tones and balanced rendering of whites, shadows and everything in between.
iPhone 16e is available in white and black with 128GB, 256GB or 512GB storage starting at $719.
Ordering is possible as early as Friday, Feb. 21, after which this model will be available starting Friday, Feb. 28.

Apple has released a sleeker and more expensive version of its lowest priced iPhone in an attempt to widen the audience for a bundle of artificial intelligence technology that the company has been hoping will revive demand for its most profitable product lineup.
The iPhone 16e unveiled Wednesday is the fourth-generation of a model that’s sold at a dramatically lower price than the iPhone’s standard and premium models. The previous bargain-bin models were called the iPhone SE, with the last version coming out in 2022.
Like the higher-priced iPhone 16 lineup unveiled last September, the iPhone 16e includes the souped-up computer chip needed to process an array of AI features that automatically summarize text, audio and create on-the-fly emojis while smartening up the device’s virtual assistant, Siri. It will also have a more powerful battery and camera.
All those upgrades will translate into a higher starting price for an iPhone 16e at $600, a 40% increase from $430 for the last iPhone SE. But iPhone 16e will be more affordable than the cheapest standard iPhone 16 at $800. The new phone will be available in stores Feb. 28, but can be pre-ordered beginning Friday.
“We’re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people,” said Kaiann Drance, an Apple vice president in charge of promoting a device lineup that accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.
Although Apple has been hyping its foray into AI since last June, the complete set of features still haven’t been released in the U.S. and the technology still isn’t even available in some parts of the world.
The delays in making the iPhone’s AI — dubbed “Apple Intelligence’"" — more widely available through free software updates dinged the Cupertino, California, company during the past holiday when sales of the device dipped slightly from their 2023 levels.
Apple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasn’t yet specified when the iPhone's AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring.
Besides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do.
Apple's shares edged up during Wednesday's late mornng trading to nearly $245, below the stock's peak price of roughly $260 reached in late December.

LONDON - Emburse, whose leading travel and expense solutions power forward-thinking organizations, today brings Apple Pay to UK customers. Cardholders who live in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland can now add Emburse Cards to their Apple Wallet and make purchases in-person or online wherever tap or Apple Wallet is accepted. It's a safer, more secure and private way to pay that helps customers avoid handing their payment card to someone else, touching physical buttons or exchanging cash - and uses the power of iPhone to protect every transaction.
An Emburse Card is a corporate card that comes with built-in controls. The card gives businesses greater visibility over spending than traditional corporate cards. Organizations can set customisable spending limits and assign unique budgets for each card as well as restrict purchases at specific merchants or categories. An Emburse Card can be pre-configured with these controls and gives organizations a greater understanding of employee spending compared to cash or a personal card. Integration with Apple Pay means that adoption of an Emburse Card becomes effortless, providing businesses with fast and convenient contactless payments without needing a physical card.
To use an Emburse Card with Apple Pay, customers simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near a payment terminal to make a contactless payment. Every Apple Pay purchase is secure because it is authenticated with Face ID, Touch ID, or device passcode, as well as a one-time unique dynamic security code. Apple Pay is accepted in grocery stores, pharmacies, taxis, restaurants, coffee shops, retail stores, and many more places.
Customers can also use Apple Pay on iPhone, iPad, and Mac to make faster and more convenient purchases in apps or on the web in Safari without having to create accounts or repeatedly type in shipping and billing information. Apple Pay makes it easier to pay for food and grocery deliveries, online shopping, transportation, and parking, among other things. Apple Pay can also be used to make payments in apps on Apple Watch.
Security and privacy are at the core of Apple Pay. When customers use a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted, and securely stored in the Secure Element, an industry-standard, certified chip designed to store the payment information safely on the device.
Apple Pay is easy to set up. On iPhone, simply open the Wallet app, tap +, and follow the steps to add Emburse Cards. Once a customer adds a card to iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac, they can start using Apple Pay on that device right away. Customers will continue to receive all of the rewards and benefits offered by Emburse Cards.

iPhone 16e joins the iPhone 16 lineup, featuring the fast performance of the A18 chip, Apple Intelligence, extraordinary battery life, and a 48MP 2-in-1 camera system — all at an incredible value
Apple® today announced iPhone® 16e, a new addition to the iPhone 16 lineup that offers powerful capabilities at a more affordable price. iPhone 16e delivers fast, smooth performance and breakthrough battery life, thanks to the industry-leading efficiency of the A18 chip and the new Apple C1, the first cellular modem designed by Apple. iPhone 16e is also built for Apple Intelligence™, the intuitive personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence while taking an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI. The 48MP Fusion camera takes gorgeous photos and videos, and with an integrated 2x Telephoto, it is like having two cameras in one, so users can zoom in with optical quality. When outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage, Apple’s groundbreaking satellite features — including Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, Messages, and Find My® via satellite — help iPhone 16e users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most.1

iPhone 16e will be available in two elegant matte finishes — black and white — with colorful cases available to accessorize. Pre-orders begin Friday, February 21, with availability beginning Friday, February 28.
“iPhone 16e packs in the features our users love about the iPhone 16 lineup, including breakthrough battery life, fast performance powered by the latest-generation A18 chip, an innovative 2-in-1 camera system, and Apple Intelligence,” said Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing. “We’re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people.”
A Beautiful and Durable Design with Breakthrough Battery Life
iPhone 16e is built to last, featuring splash, water, and dust resistance with a rating of IP68; the Ceramic Shield® front cover with an advanced formulation that is tougher than any smartphone glass; and the toughest back glass in a smartphone.2 The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR® display with OLED technology has an edge-to-edge design that is perfect for watching HDR videos, playing games, and reading crisp text.3 iPhone 16e has the best battery life ever on a 6.1-inch iPhone, lasting up to six hours longer than iPhone 11 and up to 12 hours longer than all generations of iPhone SE.4 And with Face ID® enabled by the TrueDepth® camera system, users can securely unlock their iPhone, authenticate purchases, sign in to apps, and more. iPhone 16e also offers convenient charging options, including both wireless charging and USB-C for easy connection to a wide range of accessories.
Performance and Connectivity
iPhone 16e is powered by Apple’s latest-generation A18 chip, which enables fast, smooth performance, incredible power efficiency, and Apple Intelligence. The 6-core CPU is up to 80 percent faster than the A13 Bionic chip on iPhone 11, handling both everyday and intensive tasks with ease — from simple workloads, to more demanding actions with Apple Intelligence. The 4-core GPU powers stunning graphics performance and unlocks next-level mobile gaming on the go, enabling graphically demanding AAA titles and hardware-accelerated ray tracing for more realistic lighting and reflections. The 16-core Neural Engine is optimized for large generative models and runs machine learning (ML) models up to 6x faster than A13 Bionic.
Expanding the benefits of Apple silicon, C1 is the first modem designed by Apple and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone, delivering fast and reliable 5G cellular connectivity. Apple silicon — including C1 — the all-new internal design, and the advanced power management of iOS 18 all contribute to extraordinary battery life.
Built for Apple Intelligence
iPhone 16e is built for Apple Intelligence, unlocking exciting new capabilities that make iPhone even more helpful and powerful. With the Clean Up tool, it’s easy to remove distracting elements in images, and natural language search in the Photos app allows users to search for just about any photo or video by simply describing what they are looking for.
Users can also explore creative new ways to express themselves visually with Image Playground™, create the perfect emoji with Genmoji™, and make their writing even more dynamic with Writing Tools. They can now type to Siri®, and Siri is more conversational with the ability to follow along if users stumble over their words. Siri can also maintain context from one request to the next. With extensive product knowledge, Siri can answer thousands of questions about the features and settings of Apple products, so users can learn how to do things like take a screen recording or schedule a text message to send later.
With access to ChatGPT seamlessly integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, users can choose to access ChatGPT’s expertise without jumping between applications, so they can get things done faster and easier than ever before. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in — their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won’t store requests. Users can choose whether to enable ChatGPT integration, and are in full control of when to use it and what information is shared with ChatGPT.
Apple Intelligence marks an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI and is designed to protect users’ privacy at every step. It starts with on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power Apple Intelligence run entirely on device. For requests that require access to larger models, Apple’s groundbreaking Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request.
Access Favorite Features and Unlock Visual Intelligence with the Action Button
iPhone 16e features the Action button, allowing users to easily access a variety of functions with just a press. Once customized in Settings, the Action button can be used to quickly open the camera or flashlight; switch between Ring and Silent modes; recognize music with Shazam®; activate Voice Memos, Focus, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier; or use Shortcuts for more options. The Action button can even access in-app functionality like launching the camera in Snapchat, unlocking a car door with FordPass, tracking a child’s sleep schedule with Napper, and more.
The Action button on iPhone 16e also unlocks a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence to help users learn about objects and places. Visual intelligence can summarize and copy text, translate text between languages, detect phone numbers or email addresses with the option to add to contacts, identify an animal or plant, and more. Visual intelligence also allows users to search Google so they can see where they can buy an item, or benefit from ChatGPT’s problem-solving skills. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared.
A Powerful Camera System to Capture Any Moment
The powerful 2-in-1 camera system on iPhone 16e is perfect for capturing everyday moments and important memories, including in Night mode and Portrait mode. Using computational photography, the 48MP Fusion camera takes super-high-resolution photos, so users can capture gorgeous images that balance light and detail. With an integrated 2x Telephoto, users have the equivalent of two cameras in one, and can zoom in with optical quality to get closer to the subject and easily frame their shot. And the front-facing TrueDepth camera with autofocus enables sharper close-ups and beautiful group selfies. The latest generation of HDR captures subjects and the background with true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have bright highlights, rich mid-tones, and deep shadows.
iPhone 16e takes stunning videos with the ability to record in 4K with Dolby Vision up to 60 fps, and users can stop and restart a recording for more flexibility when capturing the moment. iPhone 16e also records video in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods®, Apple Vision Pro™, or a surround sound system, and enables more ways to edit video sound with Audio Mix. Users can adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful ML algorithms automatically reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality.
Groundbreaking Safety and Communication Capabilities
iPhone 16e helps users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most. Apple’s satellite features help users text via satellite when they’re outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. This includes Messages via satellite to text friends and family; Emergency SOS via satellite to connect with emergency services; and Roadside Assistance via satellite to reach a roadside assistance provider in case of car trouble. Users can also use the Find My app to share their location via satellite, reassuring friends and family of their whereabouts while traveling off the grid. Crash Detection on iPhone 16e can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services if a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone.5
Featuring iOS 18
iOS 18 makes iPhone 16e more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever.6 With more customization options, users can give apps and widgets a new dark or tinted look and arrange them in any open space on the Home Screen. The controls at the bottom of the Lock Screen can be customized; Control Center has been redesigned to provide users with easier access to many of the things they use every day, including third-party apps; and new privacy protections include the ability to lock and hide apps to protect sensitive apps and the information inside them. iOS 18 also provides powerful updates for staying connected. In Messages, users can use text effects to bring words, phrases, sentences, and more to life. Tapbacks expand to include emoji, Genmoji, or stickers, and now users can schedule a message to send later. When messaging contacts who do not have an Apple device, the Messages app now supports RCS for richer media and more reliable group messaging when compared to SMS and MMS.
Better for the Environment
iPhone 16e is designed with the environment in mind. As part of Apple 2030, the company’s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is transitioning to renewable electricity for its manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to charge all Apple products, including iPhone 16e. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity — including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence.
To achieve Apple 2030, the company is designing products with more recycled and renewable materials, which further drives down the carbon footprint. iPhone 16e features over 30 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled cobalt and 95 percent recycled lithium in the battery, 85 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, and more.7 Additionally, the main logic board and back glass of iPhone 16e are designed to be manufactured more efficiently, reducing the amount of raw materials needed. The packaging is also entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of removing plastic from its packaging by the end of this year.8
Pricing & Availability
Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Apple’s six software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Apple’s more than 150,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth and to leaving the world better than we found it.

Why Trademarking a Logo is Important
Logos are valuable business assets uniquely capable of representing and generating goodwill for your company, business, or brand. Often, significant amounts of time and money are spent in the creation, development, and implementation of a company logo. However, many business owners are unsure about how to trademark a logo and what steps to take for federal registration. Is it really necessary to register a company logo with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (""USPTO"")? If so, what are the most common pitfalls and what can a business do to ensure a smoother process to registration? The answers to these questions will differ from case to case, but there are some common pitfalls and keys to success that apply to most cases.
Do I Really Need to Register My Company's Logo with the USPTO?
As with all trademark rights, the actual right in and to the intellectual property arises out of the use of the mark - here, the logo. Thus, if you design the logo and then use it on behalf of your company, you have trademark rights in and to that mark. (As an aside, if you commission the creation of the mark, or pay another to design the mark for your company, you will need to ensure a transfer of the ownership in the mark to your company from the third-party designer). This is known as having ""common-law trademark rights."" However, federal registration of a trademark with the USPTO confers additional rights and protections not available under common law. For example, registration of a logo with the USPTO on the Principal Register offers the following benefits and protections:
Given these benefits and the costs associated with developing a company logo, federal registration is usually advisable.
What Are the Common Pitfalls to Registering a Logo?
As with all trademarks - whether a word or design mark - there are common traps that can prevent federal registration, including the use of a generic or descriptive mark, choosing a mark too similar to another registered mark, incorporating or including geographically descriptive elements in your mark, a merely ornamental mark, or failing to properly classify your goods and/or services.
Generic or Descriptive Marks
Marks that are considered ""generic"" are not entitled to trademark protection and cannot be registered with the USPTO. In the context of a logo, this could be a fruit juice company whose logo is a generic apple or a shoe company utilizing basic clip art of a sneaker. Similarly, a descriptive or geographically descriptive logo is one that includes textual or other visual images or components that communicate the type of goods or services associated with the mark or the geographic location or region where goods or services are to be offered under the mark. For example, if the Apple computer logo were used in connection with an apple orchard or applesauce company, it could be refused registration on the basis that it is too descriptive of the goods and services to be offered under the mark. A logo that merely incorporates a business's name and location runs the risk of the same outcome. Conversely, the use of the Apple logo in connection with computers was completely arbitrary (prior to its fame) and would not be considered descriptive. The important thing to consider in designing a logo is that it must contain unique or creative elements that consumers will come to associate with your goods or services without telling your consumers what those goods and services are. For this reason, it is often a good idea to avoid commonly used icons or even emojis when designing a logo. Creating distinctive graphical elements and/or characters within a logo will result in a much stronger mark and increase your chances of securing federal registration.
Choosing a Logo Too Similar to a Registered Mark
Since the purpose of trademark protections is to allow the owner of a trademarked logo to protect its mark from copying or counterfeit use by another, attempting to register a mark that is too similar to an existing federally registered logo will trip you up and can result in a refusal to register your mark. This can be true even if the mark you have created is truly unique and creative. If someone else has already used a similar logo in connection with the same or similar goods or services, your registration is likely to be refused. Determining whether existing federally registered logos are similar to your own can be tricky and this, perhaps more than any other aspect of registering a logo, can be the most challenging. Depending on the size and scope of your intended use of the logo, it is usually advisable that you consult with an intellectual property attorney prior to adopting and launching a logo to help ensure you are not unwittingly infringing an existing mark. IP attorneys are trained in how to run a search of existing logos and can help identify ensure complete and accurate results of most value and interpret those results into opinions on risk of use and registration. Identifying similar marks early in the process will allow you to make modifications to distinguish your logo from the existing registrations and can ensure a much less complicated process to registration.
Choosing a Mark That Is Merely Ornamental
The process of registering a logo as a trademark involves not only the general appearance of the logo, itself, but also how the mark is used. To constitute ""use"" for purposes of trademark registration, the mark must be in commerce and visible on goods or, with regard to services, must be visible at the point of sale - as in on a website where the services can be purchased. A mark or use of a mark is considered ""merely ornamental"" and may be refused registration on that basis if the logo is used to adorn a product - clothing, a journal, pens, etc. - but does not appear to point to the source of the product. This often occurs in the context of clothing where a logo appears on the front of a t-shirt but cannot be distinguished from any other design portrayed on clothing. Usually, this can be avoided by including the logo in the tag sewn into the item of clothing or including a hang tag clearly demarking that logo as representing the source of the t-shirt.
Failing to Properly Classify Goods or Services
Yet another common pitfall in attempting to register a company logo is failing to properly classify the goods or services associated that the logo. When submitting a trademark application to the USPTO, the owner of the mark must identify the specific classes—or categories—of goods and/or services on which it is or intends to use the applied-for-mark. There are 45 total classes - Classes 1 through 34 cover goods and Classes 35 through 45 apply to services. As an initial matter, choosing the correct categories is essential to ensuring you have adequate protection over all the ways in which you use or intend to use your mark; if you are using the mark in a way that is not described in your application and registration, you may not have protection over that use. Still further, properly classifying your goods and services is necessary to efficiently navigate the registration process as well. If the Examiner assigned to review your application believes the wrong classes have been identified, it can delay registration. And if your application is ever found to contain inaccurate information, you could be denied or lose your registration. This is another aspect of the trademark registration process where you may be best served to work with a knowledgeable trademark attorney.
Keys to Success
In light of these common obstacles to registration, what can you do to ensure your path to registration is as efficient and successful as possible? The keys to successfully registering a logo can include the following: (1) consulting a trademark attorney from the beginning and involving them in logo selection, (2) conducting a trademark search (or having your attorney conduct one) to avoid selecting a logo that is too similar to a registered mark, and (3) clearly defining your use of the logo and ensuring that you continue to use it consistently and accurately throughout the application process.
Consult a Trademark Attorney to Ensure Your Logo is Neither Generic Nor Descriptive
Registering a company logo can present unique challenges, particularly since the descriptive type of logo that is most easily recognized and identified by consumers (from a marketing perspective) may be refused registration if it is too descriptive or even generic. Working with a trademark attorney from the development stage can help you navigate this dichotomy and ensure you design a logo that is easily recognizable while also registrable.
Run a Trademark Search for Similar Logos
As mentioned above, searching for other uses of a logo can prove challenging. Still, conducting your due diligence is necessary to ensure that you do not select a logo that not only may be difficult to register, but could subject you to penalties for trademark infringement. Most trademark attorneys have training and experience specific to searching for logos and other graphic art and are likely the best situated to assist with this important step. Depending on the results of any given search, your attorney can assist in revising or revamping the logo to avoid confusion with an existing mark, both in an effort to make the registration process smoother and to increase your chances of successfully obtaining registration.
Define Your Use Accurately and Use the Logo Consistently
Finally, consulting with a trademark attorney to determine the proper scope of your use or intended use related to a logo, and ensuring the categories of goods or services are properly and accurately identified in the application, will go a long way toward avoiding unnecessary speed bumps in the registration process.
Additionally, as important as properly defining the scope of your use is the need to ensure proper and consistent use of your logo throughout the registration process. For example, when a logo includes text, all use of the logo going forward must include the same text, in the same location in relation to any graphic or other images. That means that if your application consists of an image with specific text to the left of the image, your use of the logo going forward must always show the text to the left of the image. This is because any material alteration to a logo renders it a new logo in the eyes of the USPTO. A scenario we encounter frequently involves a marketing department's update to a company's website that includes ""tweaks"" to the company logo while an application for that logo is pending. Depending on how the logo is altered, the Examiner may see the revised image on the website while reviewing the application and reject it on the basis of ""no use in commerce.""
While navigating the process of federal trademark registration for a company logo can be tricky, avoiding the common pitfalls and utilizing these keys to success can help ensure your process is as efficient as possible and, ultimately, increase your odds of securing registration.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -     Nine people were arrested during a raucous demonstration outside a New York City Tesla dealership on Saturday, protesting owner Elon Musk's role in sweeping cuts to the federal workforce at the behest of President Donald Trump.
The protest, which police said involved hundreds of people, was one of a wave of ""Tesla Takedown"" demonstrations staged across the country targeting billionaire Musk, who is spearheading the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
Throngs of protesters also descended on the electric vehicle maker's showrooms in Jacksonville, Florida, Tucson, Arizona, and other cities, blocking traffic, chanting and waving signs reading ""Burn a Tesla: Save Democracy,"" and ""No Dictators in the USA.""
Musk, the world's richest person, is leading an unprecedented push to shrink the federal government that has resulted in the firing of thousands of employees and the termination of hundreds of aid contracts and federal leases.
Tesla and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to attempts to seek comment by phone and email on Saturday night.
In some cases, federal agencies have been forced to try to hire back key workers that had been fired, including some responsible for America's nuclear weapons, scientists trying to fight a worsening outbreak of bird flu and officials responsible for supplying electricity.
At least 100,000 of the 2.3 million federal employees have agreed to buy-outs or have been fired since Trump took office on January 20.
""We are taking action at Tesla, Musk's flagship company,"" the organizers said on the website actionnetwork.org, calling for people to dump Tesla stock and ""join the picket lines.""
""Detaching Musk from Tesla would be a meaningful blow against this administration and its prerogatives, because it would be a strike against what they hold most dear: money and power,"" actor and filmmaker Alex Winter wrote in a Rolling Stone article. Winter has posted on social media that he helped organize the protests.

BOSTON (AP) — Demonstrators gathered outside Tesla stores across the U.S. Saturday to protest the automaker's billionaire CEO, Elon Musk, and his push to slash government spending on behalf of President Donald Trump.
The demonstrations are part of a growing backlash in North America and Europe to Musk's disruptive role in Washington.
Critics of Trump and Musk hope to discourage and stigmatize purchases of Tesla, the electric car company that is the world's most valuable automaker. Liberal groups for weeks have organized anti-Tesla protests in hopes of galvanizing opposition to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and energizing Democrats still demoralized by Trump's November victory.
“We can get back at Elon,” said Nathan Phillips, a 58-year-old ecologist from Newton, Massachusetts, who was protesting in Boston on Saturday. “We can impose direct economic damage on Tesla by showing up at showrooms everywhere and boycotting Tesla and telling everyone else to get out, sell your stocks, sell your Teslas.”
Musk is taking direction from Trump to slash federal spending and sharply reduce the workforce, arguing that Trump's victory gave the president and him a mandate to restructure the U.S. government. DOGE officials have swiftly gained access to sensitive databases, directed thousands of federal job cuts, canceled contracts and shut down sections of the government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development.
Musk's critics say his actions defy Congress's power to control the U.S. budget and present a host of ways for him to enrich himself. Musk leads several other companies, notably SpaceX, which conducts launches for NASA and the intelligence community, and the social media platform X.
“Protests will not deter President Trump and Elon Musk from delivering on the promise to establish DOGE and make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers across the country,"" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.
Tesla did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
More than 50 demonstrations were listed Saturday on the website Tesla Takedown, with more planned later in March from coast to coast in the United States along with England, Spain and Portugal. News reports showed demonstrations in recent days in U.S. cities including Tucson, Arizona; St. Louis; New York City; Dayton, Ohio; Charlotte; and Palo Alto, California.
Some Tesla owners have also reported their vehicles vandalized with spray painted swastikas amid what Jewish groups and observers fear is a rise in antisemitism.
Federal prosecutors charged a woman in connection with a string of vandalism against a Colorado Tesla dealership, which included Molotov cocktails being thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” spray painted on the building.
Saturday's demonstration in Boston had a festive atmosphere, with a brass band playing music as protesters carried signs and chanted. Several of the signs mocked Musk and DOGE, with one reading: “Stop Elon and his despicable Muskrats.”
“This government led by Trump and Musk, it’s gone completely off the rails and we are here to stop that,” said Carina Campovasso, a retired federal worker. “And I hope they listen.”
About 300 demonstrators protested at a Tesla dealership in New York City on Saturday. Police said nine people were taken into custody but did not elaborate on the charges they faced.
Tesla's share price has fallen by nearly a third since Trump took office, though it's still higher than it was a year ago. Musk’s current net worth is an estimated $359 billion, according to Forbes, which calculated his 2024 net worth as $195 billion.

(Reuters) -     Electric vehicle maker Polestar has secured a 12-month loan facility of up to $450 million, it said on Friday, and would delay its fourth-quarter results in April along with its annual filing for fiscal 2024.
Backed by China's Geely, the company has struggled to drum up demand for its vehicles amid a softer buying environment and strong competition from carmakers such as Tesla.

TSLA

On December 2, 2024 a Delaware judge upheld her prior January 2024 ruling that Elon Musk's compensation package, valued at $55.8 billion, had to be rescinded because it was approved in breach of the directors' fiduciary duties (Tornetta v Musk). One month later, the same Delaware judge approved a settlement wherein Tesla's directors agreed to return or forgo $919 million in compensation, which had been subject to a separate legal complaint by the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit (Police & Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit v Musk). The two cases were brought as derivative actions on behalf of shareholders of Tesla. The former action is now subject to an appeal brought by Tesla, but also an appeal by a separate group of Florida shareholders.
Aside from their important impacts on corporate governance, and the fiduciary duties of directors, the two cases are also notable for setting Delaware records for legal fee awards, with Tornetta resulting in a legal fee award of $345 million, the largest such fee approval by a Delaware Court; and Police & Fire resulting in a $167 million fee award, the fourth largest in the history of shareholder litigation in Delaware.
Discussion
In America, and unlike in Canada, the default rule is that litigants pay for their own legal expenses. However, an important exception to this ""American Rule"" is for shareholder litigation that succeeds in Court, and in so doing secures a benefit common to all shareholders. This ""common fund"" doctrine presumes that the winning party is then entitled to have their legal fees paid out of the common benefit they have created.
Delaware case law, and in particular Sugarland Industries Inc v Thomas from 1980, has developed factors to award such fees primarily on the result achieved, rather than the traditional measure of billed hours. The use of ""value billing"" allows Courts to assess the fee holistically, and to provide incentives for counsel to take on challenging cases at the risk of recovering nothing at the end. This was a particularly important factor in Tornetta where the plaintiff ""faced some of the best law firms in the country, who put plaintiff through their paces."" The action took six years to pursue, involved an extensive trial record, and was done entirely on contingency, creating a ""massive contingency risk"" for the plaintiff's counsel.
In Tornetta, the plaintiff's counsel initially sought a staggering $5.6 billion legal fee, based on the maximum value that could be saved from the rescission of Mr. Musk's compensation. The Court described that as an unjustifiable windfall, and instead valued Mr. Musk's compensation based on its fair value at the grant date, which was $2.3 billion, and applied a ""conservative"" 15% fee resulting in $345 million.
Could shareholders of a Canadian company pursue a similar funding strategy to litigate director or officer breaches of fiduciary duty, or other wrongs to the corporation? While there have been no strict equivalents to the Tesla case to date, it would seem at least theoretically possible.
All Canadian jurisdictions already employ a ""loser pays"" model whereby a successful party to litigation is presumed to be owed legal costs, though there are provincial variances as to how those costs are calculated. But common to all Canadian jurisdictions is a presumption that, absent extraordinary circumstances, the indemnification to the successful party will only be partial (in Ontario, 60% is often cited as the normal rule). The shifting cost rules of each province are therefore unable to provide the type of litigation incentives present in the Tesla cases.
An alternative route may be reliance on the corporate statutes, which provide the mechanisms by which Canadian derivative actions may be pursued, and which also confer broad judicial discretion to make orders including for the payment of ""reasonable legal fees"" (see Canada Business Corporations Act, section 240(d) and Business Corporations Act (Ontario), section 247(d)). Through those provisions, parties have been able to seek advances for legal costs, though there has been marked reticence to providing them on a full indemnification basis. A key concern of the Court is that a blanket indemnity could facilitate counsel to pursue risk-free litigation regardless of its underlying merits.
It does not appear that anyone has yet attempted to use the Canadian corporate statutes to seek approval of a contingency fee agreement. A contingent arrangement avoids the risk of encouraging risk-free litigation, as litigants' counsel still bear significant risk, but they do so with the prospect of having that risk rewarded with enhanced compensation. It therefore seems to be an open question as to whether those statutory provisions could be used as such.
In Canada, a more familiar way to pursue contingency fee funding for a claim on behalf of many claimants is the Class Proceedings Act, which provides well established mechanisms for seeking approval of contingency fees as well as litigation funding agreements. That leads to the question of whether a derivative action can be pursued in tandem as a class action. There has been some commentary which casts doubt on this, but there is at least one authority that supports the possibility. In Peppiatt v Nicol, a class action was brought by equity members of a golf club non-profit corporation. The claim asserted both personal claims by the class members, but also derivative claims of the club against a bank. The Court allowed the class and derivative claims to be joined together, which ultimately succeeded against the bank. While the counsel's fee arrangement was approved by the Court under the Class Proceedings Act, there are no reports as to what the specific arrangement was.
Contingent fee agreements may be available for the pursuit of derivative actions for the benefit of shareholders, without shareholders having to personally fund them, but there would still seem to be one important restriction: there must be a monetary recovery.
Cases such as Police and Fire Retirement System, where the claim seeks a partial repayment of funds, may be viable, but cases like Tornetta, where the benefit to the corporation is only to be restrained from issuing cheap equity, may not. In the latter type of case, the shareholders may benefit through the increased value of their shares, but there is no obvious source of money to fund legal fees, and no mechanism equivalent to the one in Delaware to allow a Court to fashion a fee award directly payable by the company, other than the usual payment of partial indemnity costs. The shareholders in such cases may be in the classic situation of a collective action problem, where collectively they have a significant interest in the pursuit of such cases, but there are no individual incentives or other mechanisms to foster their pursuit.

Authorities in Colorado have arrested a 40-year-old woman accused of repeatedly vandalizing a Tesla dealership in Loveland.
According to a statement from the police department in Loveland, a city of about 79,000 people located about 50 miles north of Denver, Lucy Grace Nelson was arrested just before midnight Monday.
Police apprehended her while she was in possession of incendiary devices and other materials commonly used in vandalism crimes, the Loveland POlice Department said.
""Detectives apprehended Nelson prior to further damage occurring,"" the statement said.
She has been charged with using explosives or incendiary devices during a felony, criminal mischief involving damages between $2,000 and $5,000 and criminal attempt to commit a Class 3 felony.
According to police, Nelson's arrest follows an investigation opened Jan. 29 into vandalism at the dealership.
On Feb. 7, police said in a statement that the dealership had been vandalized the night prior during an attempted arson attack.
""Various vehicles and the Tesla building were vandalized with graffiti, some of which were offensive and hateful in nature,"" it said.
A $100,000 cash surety bond has been issued for Nelson.
The incident comes as Tesla has become a target for public anger since its chief executive officer, Elon Musk, has joined the Trump administration. Tasked with cutting wasteful spending from the federal government, Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency has sought to cancel billions in programs and fire thousands of federal employees, which has attracted growing criticism and several lawsuits.
Among the incidents include Tesla chargers being vandalized with Nazi swastikas, as Musk has been accused of giving a Nazi salute during President Donald Trump's inauguration. The world's richest man has denied the accusation.
Tesla responded to one such incident stating it would remove the graffiti the following day.
""We will press charges for vandalism at Superchargers,"" Tesla Charging said on X, which Musk also owns.

DENVER (AP) — A woman is suspected in a string of vandalism against a Colorado Tesla dealership that included Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles, the words “Nazi cars” spray painted on the building and a message that appeared to be directed against Tesla founder Elon Musk, according to court documents.
Lucy Grace Nelson was arrested Monday in Loveland after police said she returned to the dealership there with “additional incendiary devices” and materials used in vandalism. Police are still investigating her alleged motive, department spokesperson Chris Padgett said.
The case comes amid rising concerns voiced by Democrats and some Republicans about Musk’s influence over the administration of President Donald Trump and follows recent protests at Tesla storerooms elsewhere in the U.S.
Nelson was arrested on state charges of using an incendiary device or explosives during a felony, criminal mischief and criminal attempt to commit a felony in connection with the vandalism Monday, police said. However, police said they are working with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and federal charges were likely.
Nelson, who posted bond and was released from jail Tuesday, did not immediately respond to a telephone message on Wednesday.
The arrest affidavit outlining police's evidence against Nelson suggests there could be a second person involved, noting that the person seen on surveillance video during one of the six incidents since Jan. 29 seemed to have a smaller build than Nelson. But it identified Nelson as the person seen at other times.
Padgett said police were investigating the possibility of someone else being involved. He declined to release more details about the case because of the federal investigation.
In one of the incidents, someone spray painted an obscenity believed to be directed at Musk before being chased away by a security guard, the affidavit notes.
Security footage from the dealer also showed someone throwing Molotov cocktails into a row of Tesla sedans. The affidavit said at least four vehicles worth a combined $220,000 were targeted by the incendiary devices, which were crafted from empty liquor bottles. Police said that when Nelson was arrested, in her car they observed cans of spray paint, gasoline, bottles and various cloth pieces that could be soaked with an accelerant.
A woman who answered the phone at the Tesla dealership in Loveland declined to comment. Tesla did not return an email seeking comment.

Copyright © Emerce 2023
It looks like Tesla users are turning away from its CEO Elon Musk. In January, only about half the number of Tesla's sold last year in Europe, and those disappointing sales are depressing the share price.
Tesla's share price fell so far on Tuesday that its market capitalization fell below the one trillion dollar mark again. The share price has now fallen more than 8 percent to just over $302, leaving all of the group's shares still worth a total of $973 billion.
Earlier, the Association of European Automobile Manufacturers (ACEA) announced that 34 percent more battery-electric cars were sold on the continent in January than a year earlier. During the same period, however, Tesla sales fell 45 percent.
With the share price collapse, Tesla has now lost all of its gains since Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election.
Since then, Musk has not only been responsible for massive layoffs in the U.S. federal government, but has also caused disgust with an alleged Hitler salute and his part in the election campaign of the far-right AfD.
Despite losses in recent weeks, the auto group is still worth more than General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, Hyundai and BMW combined.

Shares of industrial and transportation companies recouped some of their recent losses, as traders hedged their bets on the outlook for economic growth and inflation.
Tesla shares fell sharply after the electric vehicle maker warned that its European sales plunged 45%, reflecting consumer distaste for Chief Executive Elon Musk's insertion of himself into local politics. There are some fears that the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by Musk, could trigger a slowdown in economic activity due to ham-fisted cuts and confusion.

By Connor Hart
Shares of Tesla slipped after the company's sales fell 45% in Europe last month, and the company said it would buy certain assets from a struggling German automation-systems supplier.
Tesla's stock was trading 8.8% lower, at $301.60, ahead of Tuesday's closing bell. Despite having fallen 25% since the beginning of the year, shares are up 51% in the past 52 weeks.
The electric-vehicle maker sold 9,945 cars in January across the European Union and the U.K., down from 18,161 vehicles in the same month last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
The Austin, Texas, company's market share fell to 1% from 1.8%, the trade group said.
Also on Tuesday, Manz--which filed for insolvency late last year amid a liquidity squeeze--said Tesla Automation would take over its Reutlingen manufacturing site, as well as more than 300 employees that work there and movable tangible assets. Around 100 employees at the site would lose their jobs, Manz added.
Financial terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.

Copyright © BusinessAMBE 2023
Open Vld seems to be divided over Elon Musk. This became clear once again last weekend. Chairwoman Eva De Bleeker first expressed her support for an Elon Musk initiative, but later withdrew it. Party colleague Maurits Vande Reyde, however, still appears to be a fan of the boss of SpaceX, Tesla and X.
Key Takeaways
Elon Musk has in recent years become not only the richest man in the world, but also one of the most controversial. The latter has certainly not diminished since he threw his support behind Donald Trump. Thanks to that support, he came to head the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This is a government agency whose job is to ensure that the U.S. government makes significant savings. Musk takes a very drastic approach to this, something that has already brought him much criticism. Yet there are also many loyal supporters.
Last weekend, Musk again came into the spotlight with a striking new initiative from DOGE. Indeed, all government employees received an e-mail on Friday telling them to briefly send in five bullet points Monday morning what they had done at work over the past week. Those who did not send that e-mail would be fired. In this way, Musk says he wants to find out which government employees don't even bother to check their emails.
Deleted mail from The Bleeker
Although Elon Musk's plan quickly drew widespread criticism in the U.S., Open Vld Chairwoman Eva De Bleeker was quick to show herself in favor. She called the plan on X ""just common sense, regardless of what people are all planning in the United States."" De Bleeker also pointed out that such reporting is very common in the private sector.
That indirect support for Musk was soon widely criticized, after which the chairwoman removed her post. ""The message was: we should strive for a much more efficient government,"" she writes in a new post. Bleeker adds ""for the record"" that she is not a fan of Musk. ""On the contrary,"" it sounds.
Contention within Open Vld
So Eva De Bleeker is not a fan of Elon Musk, but on the dark blue flank of the Flemish liberals there are some big fans. These include Vincent Van Quickenborne and Flemish MP Maurits Vande Reyde.
""I have been following the man since when no one knew him. He is not only a successful entrepreneur, but also a visionary. And is he really that extreme? Is it extreme to ask officials what they have done? Is it extreme to say that government should confine itself to core tasks? I think we need our own Musk in Flanders,"" says Vande Reyde in Het Nieuwsblad.
Gwendolyn Rutten, on the other hand, is anything but a fan. She even calls Musk ""a dangerous madman"" and adds that, in her opinion, he is not liberal.
Foundation Congress
These divergent opinions prove once again the divisions within Open Vld. It promises to be an exciting few months for the party leading up to its founding congress in September. There the party will receive a new name and the liberal party will make a new start. On which line that will be, however, is not at all clear yet.

Tesla will buy certain assets from Manz, after the struggling German automation systems supplier entered into insolvency proceedings.
Tesla Automation, which specializes in constructing special-purpose machines at three German locations, will take over Manz's Reutlingen site as well as more than 300 employees that work at the site and movable tangible assets, Manz said Tuesday. Around 100 employees at Reutlingen will lose their jobs.
Tesla Automation is a subsidiary of U.S. electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla.
Manz filed for insolvency late last year amid a liquidity squeeze. Its battery cell production technology business had struggled with a deteriorating European battery cell market that faced continued weakness.
Completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of the German Federal Cartel Office.
Financial details weren't disclosed.

By Jiahui Huang
Tesla rolled out an update to its driving-assistance software in China, a move that could signal final regulatory approval is forthcoming, as the technology becomes increasingly common in the world's largest EV market.
The U.S. carmaker said in its mini-application hosted by the WeChat platform Tuesday that it has pushed out a software update for some users that includes features such as its autopilot driving assistance for city roads, an in-car camera and an updated map.
The updated driving-assistance feature can guide cars to exit ramps and intersections and recognize traffic lights for turns. The update includes automatic lane changing and can find the best routes to use when drivers don't set a particular route.
With the new update, an in-car camera can monitor if the driver is paying attention, though the video feed will be processed within the car and won't be accessible to any parties, including Tesla, according to the post.
Tesla didn't explicitly characterize the update as equivalent to full self-driving, but analysts said the functions are quite similar.
The release of the update to a select group of customers provides an early testing ground for Tesla's advanced driver-assistance system in the China market, said Nomura analyst Joel Ying.
Tesla's FSD offering is a market leader in the field, but hasn't been approved by Chinese authorities yet. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk visited Beijing last April to meet with Chinese officials, including Premier Li Qiang, about launching FSD functions in China.
Analysts expect approval for Tesla's FSD offering in China this year, as competition heats up in artificial intelligence-powered driving technology in the country following BYD's introduction earlier this month of a new system for mass-market models.
""It will take some time for Tesla to make sure its FSD is fully adapted to China market scenarios, as it could be totally different situations, especially in Tier-1 cities with large populations,"" Ying said.
For now, the update is only available for some car owners that purchased Tesla's ADAS functions with a price tag of 64,000 yuan, equivalent to around $8,800.
Musk said last month that Tesla was facing some challenges on getting approval for its own driving tech in China because Chinese authorities didn't allow Tesla to transfer video outside of the country to train its models, while U.S. authorities didn't let the carmaker train the FSD system in China. Musk also said he expects Tesla to offer unsupervised FSD in ""almost every market this year.""
When Tesla finally launches FSD in China, that should further drive popularization of AI-powered driving technology in the Chinese market, Ying said.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -     Tesla plans to update software in cars in China to add driving-assistance capabilities that will help drivers navigate city streets, according to a company notification and two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The U.S. automaker on Monday notified Chinese users of its software of the planned update to its autopilot feature but retracted the notice within minutes, showed multiple posts on Chinese social media.
The notice was authentic but sent prematurely, the two people told Reuters.
The update will give the software a less advanced version of the Full Self-Driving feature available in the United States due to insufficient data training on Chinese roads and traffic rules, one of the people said.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The software update was first reported by Bloomberg.

* Judge issues restraining order at labor unions' request

* Agencies likely violated Privacy Act of 1974, judge says

* DOGE faces multiple lawsuits from Democratic states, legal
groups

Feb 24 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday blocked the
government downsizing team created by President Donald Trump and
spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk from accessing sensitive
data maintained by the U.S. Education Department and the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management.
U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman in Greenbelt, Maryland
issued the temporary restraining order at the behest of a
coalition of labor unions who argued the agencies wrongly
granted Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency access to
records containing personal information on millions of
Americans.
The judge said the plaintiffs had established that both
agencies had likely violated federal law by granting DOGE
""sweeping access"" to sensitive personal information in violation
of the Privacy Act of 1974.
That information included Social Security numbers, dates of
birth, home addresses, income and assets, citizenship status and
disability status for current and former federal employees and
student aid recipients.
The Trump administration had argued that a ruling blocking
DOGE from accessing the information would impede the Republican
president's ability to fulfill his agenda by limiting what
information his advisors can access.
But Boardman, an appointee of Trump's Democratic
predecessor Joe Biden, said her order prevents the disclosure of
the plaintiffs’ sensitive personal information to DOGE
affiliates who, on the current record, do not have a need to
know the information to perform their duties.""
The White House did not immediately respond to a request
for comment.
DOGE has
swept through
federal agencies since the Republican president returned to
office last month and put the chief executive of carmaker Tesla
in charge of rooting out wasteful spending as part of
Trump's dramatic
overhaul of government,
which has included
thousands of job cuts
.
Several lawsuits have been filed by Democratic-led U.S.
states and liberal-leaning legal groups seeking to prevent DOGE
from accessing government systems.
On Friday, a federal judge in New York at the request of 19
Democratic state attorneys general
extended an order
blocking DOGE from accessing Treasury Department systems
responsible for trillions of dollars in government payments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration laid off 4% of its staff as part of a government-wide trimming of probationary employees, a spokesperson said Monday.
The agency has pending investigations into Tesla, which is headed by Elon Musk, the CEO of the automaker and President Donald Trump's senior adviser leading efforts to shrink the government.
NHTSA said under President Joe Biden the agency grew by 30% and is still considerably larger after the job cuts earlier this month. Its workforce was about 800 before the job cuts.

Proposed amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) introduce safe harbors for liability from transactions involving directors, officers and controlling stockholders and define and limit a stockholder's right to inspect corporate books and records.
Long considered a business-friendly state because of its corporate tax advantages and, more importantly, the Court of Chancery - a unique court of equity composed of sophisticated jurists responsible for case law that has shaped how Delaware corporations operate - Delaware has come under fire in recent years for being “too favorable” to minority stockholders. This has led several corporations with large controlling stockholders, including Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink (all controlled by Elon Musk), to reincorporate out of Delaware, and several others, including Meta, Dropbox and Pershing Square Capital Management, to announce plans to leave Delaware. The proposed amendments to the DGCL attempt to stem the tide by making it more difficult for minority stockholders to prove that a transaction in which a director, officer or controlling stockholder has a financial interest was not entirely fair to a corporation and by limiting corporate books and records a minority stockholder may inspect.
Background
On February 17, 2025, Senate Bill 21 was introduced in the Delaware General Assembly, proposing significant amendments to Section 144 of the DGCL with respect to interested directors and officers and controlling stockholder transactions, and to Section 220 of the DGCL with respect to inspection of books and records by stockholders.
Senate Bill 21 is unusual because of the ostensible enhanced protection for corporate directors, officers and controlling stockholders the amendments would provide, and because of the manner in which the bill was introduced.
Historically, amendments to the DGCL have been formulated by the Corporation Law Council of the Corporation Law Section of the Delaware State Bar Association and recommended to the Delaware General Assembly after approval by the Delaware State Bar Association. The amendments proposed in Senate Bill 21, in contrast, were introduced by a bipartisan group of lawmakers without following the traditional process and with drafting assistance from the Delaware law firm that represents Tesla and Elon Musk.
Continue reading for a more detailed summary of the proposed amendments.
Proposed Amendments to Section 144
The first section of Senate Bill 21 proposes a number of safe harbors for liability arising from acts or transactions involving directors, officers and controlling stockholders.
The proposed amendments to Section 144(a) provide a safe harbor for liability arising from any act or transaction involving or between a corporation and a director or officer of the corporation, or any organization in which a director or officer of the corporation has a financial interest, if the act or transaction is:
The proposed amendments to Section 144(b) provide a safe harbor for liability arising from any controlling stockholder transaction (other than a going private transaction), if the transaction is:
New proposed Section 144(c) provides a safe harbor for liability arising from any controlling stockholder transaction constituting a going private transaction, if the transaction is:
New proposed Section 144(d) provides several parameters to the safe harbors, including:
New proposed Section 144(e) defines several key terms used in the safe harbors.
Proposed Amendments to Section 220
The second section of Senate Bill 21 proposes several changes to inspection of books and records of a Delaware corporation.
The proposed amendments to Section 220(a) define “books and records” (previously undefined), which a stockholder may inspect in accordance with that Section, to include:
The proposed amendments to Section 220 additionally limit a stockholder's right to inspect and copy the corporation's books and records to situations where only all three of the following are true:
Further, under the proposed amendments to Section 220, the corporation may impose reasonable restrictions on the confidentiality, use, or distribution of books and records and it may redact portions of the books and records not specifically related to the stockholder's purpose. The corporation may also condition production of books and records on the demanding stockholder's agreement that any information in the corporation's books and records be deemed incorporated by reference in any complaint filed in relation to the subject matter referenced in the demand for inspection.
What This May Mean for You
Directors, officers and controlling stockholders of Delaware corporations should be aware that the proposed amendments, if enacted into law, may change legal practice with respect to initiating, negotiating or approving a transaction in which a director, officer or controlling stockholder has a financial interest. In order to obtain the benefit of the proposed safe harbors from liability, these parties should follow the processes outlined and obtain advice of counsel.
Legal news and commentary on Senate Bill 21 indicate that it is a significant data point in a larger conversation about the balance of power between corporate insiders and minority stockholders and Delaware's continued primacy as the preferred jurisdiction for incorporation. Expect further news and updates after Senate Bill 21 is first heard at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing planned for March 12.

TSLA


OXON HILL, Md. (AP) — At an annual gathering of conservative activists, the signature red “ Make America Great Again ” hats popularized by President Donald Trump were interspersed with a noticeable number of the black “Dark MAGA” hats made popular by Elon Musk.
It was just one sign of Musk's emerging influence and how the world's wealthiest man — who once backed DemocratsBarack Obama and Joe Biden — has become a conservative power center in his own right due to his connections to Trump.
“He is an authentic and unique individual. I am glad he is on the team,” said Whitney Mason, a 62-year-old real estate agent who was traveling from Seattle.
Musk was an unexpected guest of honor at the Conservative Political Action Conference, with his appearance announced hours before he took the stage wielding a chainsaw. The prop, and his comments, left little subtlety about his role or his influence, days after the Trump administration claimed in court that Musk was not in charge of his signature Department of Government Efficiency.
Speakers at CPAC frequently brought up DOGE, playfully named after a meme coin with the face of a Shiba Inu dog popularized by Musk in 2021. They variously referred to him as a “white knight,” a “hero of free speech,” and according to one of his harshest critics, Steve Bannon, “Superman.”
“What Elon and the team are doing is what Congress has not had the ability to do,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson told the crowd of conservatives. ""They have cracked the code they’re inside the belly of the beast of the bureaucracy, and the algorithms are crawling through.""
The Trump administration, under Musk’s advice, has fired thousands of federal workers without warning. It gave employees an option to resign and gutted agencies without congressional approval. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who bought Twitter in 2022, has pledged to identify areas to cut costs and streamline services and save trillions of taxpayer dollars, with directives that spark confusion and have prompted demonstrations across agencies.
As Trump spoke at CPAC on Saturday, Musk announced federal workers would get an email to explain what they accomplished over the last week, saying “failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”
“Elon is doing a great job,” Trump said in his speech on Saturday. “We love Elon, don’t we? He’s a character.”
Critics have said that Musk could stand to benefit from his close relationship with Trump as there are a number of federal investigations and safety programs created through federal agency orders that are hitting Tesla's plans to create fleets of robo-taxis and self-driving cars. Musk's SpaceX also has major contracts with the Pentagon, NASA and intelligence agencies.
Colin McEvers, a 19-year old who voted for Trump, admires Vice President JD Vance and praised Musk’s business acumen, said he was concerned about Musk's growing power in the federal government and the decline of regulations that were protecting workers from big corporations.
“I like the basic principle of making government more efficient and cutting back on costs,” said McEvers, a political science student at Salisbury University. “Do I think that there could be a lot of self-interest involved with him, with the richest man in the world playing a very large role in government in reducing these regulations, which could very well end up profiting his businesses? I definitely think that’s probably a very large part of it too.”
The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk’s other companies.
Musk’s positions on issues like H-1B visas for high-skilled immigrant workers have made him a target of popular MAGA figures such as Bannon, who once served as Trump’s chief strategist and hosts the influential “War Room” podcast. Musk was born in South Africa and was once on an H-1B visa.
Bannon has previously cast the world’s richest man as a “parasitic illegal immigrant” and an “oligarch,” who will abandon Trump when he deems him no longer useful. Bannon didn't criticize Musk at CPAC and instead faced scrutiny for making a straight-arm gesture on stage that critics on the right and left compared to a Nazi-style salute. Bannon said he was giving the crowd a wave.
A few miles away, at a Washington hotel near the White House, more than a thousand anti-Trump activists and thought leaders gathered at the Principles First Summit and laughed repeatedly as another billionaire, Mark Cuban, charged that Trump was “overselling” and Musk's actions so far were not helping people who voted for the Republican president.
“Elon is going to make his job a thousand times harder,"" Cuban said using expletives to accuse Musk of not caring.
Trump on Saturday posted on Truth Social that he “WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE."" During his speech, Trump trivialized complaints that Musk does not have an official role in his government despite his strong influence on decisions during his first month in office.
“People said ‘well, what official position does he have?’ I say patriot,” Trump said.

Key takeaways
A Japanese consortium wants Tesla to invest in Nissan after the failure of merger talks between Nissan and Honda. The plan involves former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Hiro Mizuno, a former Tesla board member.
The group hopes that Tesla, led by Elon Musk, will become a strategic investor in Nissan. This would allow Tesla to use Nissan's underused US factories for more domestic production amid concerns about US import duties.
Financial support
Moody's downgraded Nissan's credit rating earlier this week because of low profitability due to weak demand for their current model line. The company announced a significant workforce reduction last year after a dramatic 93 percent drop in net profit in the first half of the year and expects an annual loss of more than $500 million.
This proposed investment comes after Nissan's rejection of Honda's $58 billion merger bid, which fueled concerns about possible acquisitions by foreign investors. This includes Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn, which tried to acquire a majority stake in Nissan last December. It then tried to get Renault to sell its 35 percent stake in the company, but these attempts were abandoned before merger talks with Honda were announced.
Manufacturing and expansion
Experts believe Tesla's involvement could reduce the risk of foreign takeovers while expanding Tesla's manufacturing presence in the United States. Nissan's plants in the U.S. have a combined capacity to produce 1 million vehicles annually, but currently produce only about 525,000 units per year.
It is important to note that neither Tesla, Musk, Nissan or others directly involved have officially confirmed this development.

NASA awarded a contract to Elon Musk's SpaceX to provide launch services for the agency's near-Earth object surveyor mission.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Friday said the launch service will cost around $100 million.
The mission, aimed at detecting and observing asteroids and comets that could pose an impact threat to Earth, is targeted to launch no earlier than September 2027 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Florida.
The mission will conduct a five-year baseline survey to detect at least two-thirds of unknown near-Earth objects larger than 140 meters. Those could cause significant damage if they were to impact Earth, NASA said.

Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's Trump Media & Technology Group
said on Friday it will propose reincorporating the company in Florida at its annual meeting in
late April.
""We look forward to uniting our legal home with our physical home as we explore
possibilities for mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, and other growth,"" said CEO Devin Nunes.
Nunes added that the company is committed to Florida, which ""shows tremendous respect for
free enterprise.""
The proposal comes as several companies, including Dropbox and Bill Ackman's
management company, have recently said they were moving or considering moving their
incorporation out of Delaware.
The Wall Street Journal reported in late January that social media giant Meta Platforms
is in discussions about moving its incorporation from Delaware to Texas or other
states.
Elon Musk's Tesla and SpaceX moved their state of incorporation to Texas from
Delaware after a Chancery judge last year ordered Musk's $56 billion pay package from Tesla to
be rescinded.
For Trump Media, a Delaware judge had ruled in September that the company breached an
agreement with Orlando's ARC Global and the fund must receive more than half a million
additional shares before a lock-up on insider sales expires.

TSLA

More than 375,000 Tesla vehicles are being recalled because of issues with their power steering systems, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a notice issued Friday.
The recall applies to Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles with software dating from before 2023, according to the NHTSA.
The company has announced a software fix for affected vehicles.
The NHTSA recall notice alerts drivers to the possibility of vehicles' power steering electronic circuit board becoming overstressed. That stress could cause a loss of power steering during stops and starts.
That power loss could increase the risk of a crash, with drivers needing to exert more force to maintain steering control.
This marks the 15th NHTSA recall of the 2023 Model Y, mostly related to software.
The NHTSA opened an Engineering Analysis into the issue earlier in the month.
Owners of affected vehicles will receive a letter in the mail informing them of the recall.
Last month, an unrelated software problem forced Tesla to issue a recall of more than 239,000 of its Model 3, S, X and Y vehicles. That problem related to a possible disabling of the vehicles' rearview cameras.

Former Tesla board member Hiromichi Mizuno denied a Financial Times report that says he leads a Japanese group seeking an investment in Nissan Motor from Elon Musk's carmaker.
""I have absolutely no involvement in what is reported in this article and am unaware of any such moves by the Japanese government,"" Mizuno said in a post on X.
Mizuno added that while he isn't with Tesla anymore, he doubts Tesla has any interest in acquiring Nissan's U.S. factories.
The Financial Times report said Mizuno led a group, including ex-premier Yoshihide Suga and his former aide Hiroto Izumi, that planned to court Tesla for an investment in Nissan and believed Tesla was interested in Nissan's U.S. plants.

Tesla is recalling more than 375,000 vehicles due to a power steering issue.
The recall is for certain 2023 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles operating software prior to 2023.38.4, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The printed circuit board for the electronic power steering assist may become overstressed, causing a loss of power steering assist when the vehicle reaches a stop and then accelerates again, the agency said.
The loss of power could required more effort to control the car by drivers, particularly at low speeds, increasing the risk of a crash.
Tesla isn't aware of any crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the condition.
The electric vehicle maker headed by Elon Musk has released a free software update to address the issue.
Letters are expected to be sent to vehicle owners on March 25.
Owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752 or the NHTSA at 1-888-327-4236.

(Alliance News) - Italy's competition watchdog said Friday it has launched an investigation into four electric vehicle manufacturers, including Tesla Inc and Stellantis NV, for alleged unfair trade practices.

The four separate investigations target BYD Industria Italia, Stellantis Europe, Tesla Italy, and Volkswagen Group Italia, all Italian or European subsidiaries of the multinational automakers.

The investigations concern information provided to consumers about driving range, battery degradation and limitations on battery warranties, all ""potentially in violation"" of Italian consumer protection laws,"" the Competition Authority wrote in a note.

""Companies' websites appear to have displayed generic, sometimes contradictory information about the driving range of their marketed electric vehicles, without clarifying what factors affect the advertised maximum range and to what extent they affect the actual range,"" the regulator said.

The websites also do not provide ""clear and complete information"" on how the battery capacity of their electric vehicles may degrade due to normal vehicle use and the limitations of the warranties offered.

The regulator said it conducted an inspection at all four companies Thursday, along with the Finance Guard.

The lifespan of electric vehicle batteries depends on multiple factors. Degradation, which reduces energy capacity, can occur due to extremely cold weather conditions and uneven charging.

Tesla shares fell 0.5 percent in pre-market trading to USD352.76 each Friday in New York while Stellantis rose 1.8 percent to EUR13.57 per share in Milan.

TSLA

During the biggest night in music, the 2025 Grammy awards ceremony, Kanye's wife, Bianca Censori, caused quite a commotion by walking the red carpet when she removed her coat to reveal . . . just about everything. Her dress, if you can call it that, was completely sheer. And after I uttered, ""Well, that's a . . . choice,"" I started thinking about the legalities associated with employee dress codes (as one does).

Dress Codes Generally
How your employees dress should reflect your company culture. Whether you have a dress-up or dress-down culture, employers should clearly define dress code expectations and communicate them to employees. Your guidelines should be relatively simple. Provide clear examples of what is and what is not acceptable in your workplace (jeans and polo shirts - in; see through dresses that leave nothing to the imagination - out). Employers should use gender neutral language in describing appropriate attire (long gone are the days of requiring women to wear panty hose and skirts). Also consider the diversity of your workforce and the possibility that some employees may prefer to wear their own cultural attire in the workplace.
If any of your employees work remotely or if you use videoconferencing in your business, you should also review your policies to determine if they even address how your employees should be presenting themselves when they are ""on camera"" either doing business in-house or with customers, vendors, etc. Make it clear what is acceptable and what is not while the employee is ""on camera"" representing the company.
Accommodations and Dress Codes
Under Title VII, employers are required to reasonably accommodate employees with disabilities and employees who have closely held religious beliefs. ThoseThese accommodations may include modifications to the employer's dress code for that employee. Employers should engage in the interactive process with any employee who requests a modification to the company's dress code. Remember, under Title VII, employers must now accommodate an employee's closely held religious belief unless the accommodation would cause the employer undue hardship.
The NLRA and Dress Codes
In 2022, the NLRB issued Tesla, Inc., 370 NLRB No. 131 (2022), which held that workplace uniform rules limiting employees' ability to wear union apparel or insignia are unlawful absent a showing of ""special circumstances."" In the Tesla opinion, the Board gave examples of special circumstances which included, ""when their display may jeopardize employee safety, damage machinery or products, exacerbate employee dissension, or unreasonably interfere with a public image that the employer has established, or when necessary to maintain decorum and discipline among employees."" But these exceptions have rarely been recognized outside of the healthcarehealthcare or retail settings. Keep in mind, however, that the definition of ""special circumstances"" will likely broaden under the second Trump administration.
The FLSA and Uniforms
Not all dress codes require uniforms but if you require hourly employees to wear certain attire, particularly if the attire is branded or otherwise recognized as part of your brand, you need to be sure you comply with the FLSA. If an employer requires an employee to wear a uniform, the cost and maintenance of that uniform is considered a business expense of the employer under the FLSA. This means that if the employee is required by the employer to bear the cost, it may not reduce the employee below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. For example, if an employer pays an employee $8 per hour and the employee works 20 hours per week, an employer cannot legally deduct more than $15 ($0.75 x 20) for the cost of the uniform for that work week. (Remember, many states have rules regarding how to legally deduct from employee paychecks as well). Further, the cost of maintaining the uniform may have to be borne by the employer if the uniform is something other than ""wash and wear"" which the employee can launder with their own clothing. The DOL has some useful guidance regarding uniforms and the FLSA here: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-L36-PURL-gpo24664/pdf/GOVPUB-L36-PURL-gpo24664.pdf
Clothing and Hate speech
And speaking of Kanye . . . Recently Kanye West made headlines when he marketed and sold a swastika t-shirt. Remember, hate speech is never protected speech, and should be banned in your workplace. Any employee who uses their work attire to engage in hate speech should be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

The workers fired by the agency headed by the Tesla CEO said they do not believe they were targeted because they are examining driverless cars, the newspaper reported.
The autonomous vehicles safety unit cuts are part of reductions at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is losing about 10% of its workforce through firings and buyout offers, according to the Washington Post.

TSLA

Feb 20 (Reuters) - Rivian forecast modest gross
profit this year, after reporting its first-ever positive
earnings margin in the fourth quarter, as factory upgrades and
supplier renegotiations improved efficiency at the EV maker.
Shares of the Irvine, California-based EV maker were up
about 4% in extended trading.
However, Rivian projected an unexpected drop in deliveries
for the year as an uncertain economy and shifting consumer
preferences temper demand for its more expensive electric pickup
trucks and SUVs.
Its gross profit stood at $170 million in the fourth
quarter, compared with a loss of $606 million a year earlier.
The company also expects higher costs from U.S. President
Donald Trump's plans to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada.
""We have a supply chain that does have a footprint in both
Mexico and Canada, and so large tariffs being applied will just
translate to higher costs for us,"" CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters.
""There is such a high level of uncertainty that will
ultimately impact consumer behavior and top-line revenue,"" he
added.
Rivian forecast annual deliveries of between 46,000 and
51,000 vehicles, lower than Wall Street expectations of 55,520,
according to 15 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Last year, it
delivered 51,579 units.
The EV maker is also planning to halt production for more
than a month in the second half of 2025 to upgrade its assembly
lines, as it gears up to launch the Tesla Model Y-rivaling R2
vehicle and start its deliveries early next year.
EV makers are staring at a tough market, with Elon Musk-led
market leader Tesla reporting its first drop in annual sales in
2024.
Electric big rig manufacturer Nikola recently filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and said it would pursue a
sale of its assets after struggling with rapid cash burn and
funding challenges amid weak demand.
Rivian, too, continues to burn billions of dollars in cash
every year. However, the rate at which it expends cash is
expected to slow as profitability improves along with its sales
volumes.
Revenue for the last three months of the year stood at $1.73
billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.4
billion, according to LSEG data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     President Donald Trump's nominee to serve as the second highest ranking official at the U.S. Transportation Department vowed the government will take a fair and objective approach to overseeing auto safety probes into Tesla.
Asked if he would commit to ensuring auto safety regulators hold Tesla accountable, nominee Steve Bradbury said yes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in October opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) software after four reported collisions, including a fatal 2023 crash, among other open safety probes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     Federal regulators have cited Tesla for violating workplace safety rules in connection with the electrocution of a worker last summer at its Austin, Texas, auto-manufacturing plant.
The U.S. Department of Labor confirmed the findings in a statement to Reuters.
""The investigation is closed and citations have been issued,"" said the department, which oversees the agency that conducted the Tesla probe, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
The Labor Department said the matter was concluded in late January. The department declined to disclose the nature of Tesla's workplace-safety failures or whether any penalties were imposed.
The case has been closely watched amid public debate about the oversight of Tesla and other businesses run by billionaire Elon Musk as he directs a radical overhaul of federal agencies on behalf of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Musk, who spent more than $250 million to help elect Trump, now steers the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which aims to slash federal spending and staffing. Musk's businesses, including Tesla and rocket-maker SpaceX, rely heavily on government contracts, subsidies and policies.
OSHA launched the investigation immediately after the August 1 death of Victor Gomez Sr., an electrician working as a contractor at the Tesla plant in Texas, according to OSHA records and a wrongful death lawsuit filed against Tesla by Gomez's family.
Gomez was killed while inspecting electrical panels at the site, according to the suit. The lawsuit alleges negligence and argues that the panel was supposed to be inactive but had already been powered up, resulting in Gomez's electrocution.
Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not immediately access court filings by Tesla in the lawsuit.
On Wednesday, U.S. Representative Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat whose congressional district includes the Tesla plant, sent a letter to the Labor Department urging that OSHA immediately release the full results of its investigation of Gomez's death. The letter said that a refusal to release public records on Tesla's workplace safety failures could raise questions about whether the agency is giving Musk preferential treatment.
""Americans have a right to know whether Tesla and its contractors put a man's life at risk, and whether Tesla will follow workplace safety rules going forward,"" the letter read.
The plant, a 10-million square-foot facility in Austin, Texas, is a manufacturing hub for Tesla's Model Y vehicles and Cybertrucks.
OSHA records show Tesla was cited and fined about $7,000 for two other workplace safety violations at the Texas plant last year, both involving violations of rules to protect workers from chemical hazards. In 2022, the company also was hit with a pair of complaints claiming that it failed to address alleged workplace-safety and wage-law violations by subcontractors during the construction of the facility.

Key takeaways
Talks are underway for ElonMusk's social media platform, formerly known as Twitter and now called X, to receive financing at a valuation of $44 billion. This amount corresponds to the price Musk paid to take over the company in 2022. Sources familiar with the situation have indicated that negotiations are progressing, but that the details of the funding round are still subject to change. It is also possible that X may ultimately choose to forgo fundraising altogether.
Funding round
This potential investment round would be the first since Musk made X private in 2022. The platform has faced financial difficulties following Musk's acquisition and subsequent changes to the platform, leading to a significant exodus of users and advertisers. Recent developments, however, suggest a positive shift. Fidelity Investments recently downgraded its stake in X by about 70 percent from the acquisition price, but other indicators point to growing confidence in X's future.
Financial revaluation
X's debt has also undergone a positive revaluation. Morgan Stanley successfully sold $3 billion worth of X debt last week at face value, without discount. This is a significant improvement over previous attempts to sell the debt, which met resistance from potential buyers. Strong investor demand indicates increasing confidence in X's financial stability and prospects.
AI ambitions
Elon Musk's other ventures have also achieved notable success recently. Tesla Inc, his electric vehicle company, has seen its share price rise more than 40 percent since the election of President Donald Trump, a period during which Musk has maintained close ties with the president. SpaceX, Musk's aerospace company, has reached an incredible $350 billion valuation, further cementing its status as the world's largest technology startup.
AI funding
Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is currently seeking funding at an estimated valuation of $75 billion. This proposed valuation reflects growing investor interest in Musk's AI ambitions. X owns a $6 billion stake in xAI, further reinforcing the financial interconnectedness of his various businesses. As a result, the economic performance of his companies is becoming more closely linked.
Investor confidence
The impact of Musk's close ties to President Donald Trump on perceptions of x's future is also noteworthy. Some investors believe Musk's political connections could benefit his companies, including X, by furthering their interests in regulatory and policy issues. Prominent investors who supported Musk's acquisition of X in 2022 include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and the Qatar Investment Authority. Their continued support may be crucial to the success of the current funding round.

WASHINGTON (AP) — It's been a burning political question for weeks: How long will President Donald Trump — who doesn’t like sharing the spotlight — be able to do just that with Elon Musk, a billionaire also overly fond of attention?
In a joint Fox News Channel interview that aired Tuesday, both insisted they like each other a lot and would stick with their arrangement despite what Trump said were attempts by the media to “drive us apart.”
At times, Trump sat back as Fox News Channel'sSean Hannity heaped praise on Musk in an attempt to counteract a Democratic narrative that he's a callous and unelected force out to destroy the government and upend civil society through sweeping cuts being imposed by the Department of Government Efficiency.
There were also moments when Trump and Musk were all but finishing each other's sentences, as if they were part of a buddy comedy and not the president and his most powerful aide.
Here's a look at how the friendship formed, what it means for them both and why Trump's history suggests it may not last:
Trump told Hannity that he wasn't really acquainted with Musk until recently, saying, “I knew him a little bit through the White House originally"" but didn’t know him before that.
Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and became a U.S. citizen in 2002. He's the world’s richest man, with a net worth exceeding $400 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His vast business holdings include X, Tesla and SpaceX, as well as the satellite internet service provider Starlink.
Musk said he voted for Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 and Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Musk has recently said that Tesla was being unfairly targeted by regulations in its original home state of California. Musk and the company's headquarters moved to Austin, Texas in 2021, and he increasingly soured on Biden with the then-president's embrace of unions that clashed frequently with Tesla.
In the past, Musk butted heads with Trump over climate change. They feuded as recently as July 2022 — with Trump calling Musk a “bulls—- artist."" He also suggested then that Musk came to the White House during his first term seeking federal subsidies for “electric cars that don’t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere.”
""I could have said, ‘drop to your knees and beg,’ and he would have done it,” Trump previously said on his social media site.
Musk originally backed Ron DeSantis in last year’s Republican presidential primary, even helping the Florida governor launch his White House bid in a glitch-marred presentation on X. But Musk met with Trump at his Florida residence last March and endorsed the then-canidate in July shortly after the first assassination attempt.
“I was going to do it anyway, but that was a precipitating event,” Musk told Hannity.
Musk appeared at his first Trump rally in early October, and his super PAC spent around $200 million to boost the Republican's campaign. X also amplified messaging — and often disinformation — promoted by Trump and his “Make America Great Again” movement.
The pair spent election night at the president's Mar-a-Lago club. Less than a week after securing victory, Trump announced that Musk would lead DOGE, the new push to shrink government, alongside former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who left the commission by Inauguration Day.
Trump has empowered Musk to help him keep a campaign promise and “ shatter the deep state ” by firing scores of federal workers, shrinking or shuttering agencies and slashing the size of government.
“There’s a vast federal bureaucracy that is implacably opposed to the the president,” Musk told Hannity. He added: ""What we’re seeing here is the sort of the thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try to restore democracy and the will of the people.”
Tesla and SpaceX have benefited from lucrative government contracts from the Defense Department, NASA and other federal entities, as well as plenty of tax breaks and subsidies over the years. The Trump administration could also take a lot of regulatory heat off Musk, including dismissing crash investigations into Tesla’s partially automated vehicles and a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars’ self-driving capabilities.
Musk nonetheless insisted to Hannity, “I haven’t asked the president for anything, ever."" Trump said the billionaire “won't be involved” in areas where his government efforts and business concerns overlap — though that seems dubious given that Musk's team has already begun scrutinizing federal contracts in areas that would seem to present conflict-of-interest concerns.
Trump and Musk say they won't turn on each other. But those once closest to Trump often end up as his fiercest critics.
His former vice president, Mike Pence, said Trump endangered his family in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol and attempted to bully him into violating the Constitution. His former attorney general, Bill Barr, refuted Trump's falsehoods about widespread fraud in the 2020 election and has since said he “shouldn't be anywhere near the Oval Office.""
Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime lawyer who testified against him in a hush money case, told a House committee in 2019: “People that follow Mr. Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering.”
More recently, Trump shrugged off potential security risks while ending Secret Service protection for former top officials in his first administration, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former White House chief of staff John Kelly.
Trump also has shown repeatedly that he doesn't like being overshadowed, even hinting at such where Musk is concerned. Asked recently about Musk appearing on the cover of Time from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Trump quipped, “Is Time Magazine still in business?”
But Trump has also been fiercely loyal to those he perceives as having stood by him.
Former White House adviser Peter Navarro, who served time in prison related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, is back helping dictate Trump trade policy. Trump's valet, Walt Nauta, is working anew at the White House after once being a codefendant with Trump in the classified documents case. Trump has also said he'd offered “about 10 jobs” to his former national security adviser, Mike Flynn, whom he pardoned after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.
Throughout the interview, Hannity was friendly and his questions were mostly fawning. But what came through was how complimentary Trump and Musk were of each other — even amid skepticism about how long that'll last.
“He’s an amazing person,” Trump said of Musk.
“I love the president, I just want to be clear about that,” Musk offered of Trump.
“I feel like I’m interviewing two brothers here,” Hannity finally said.

Tesla has identified sites for showrooms in New Delhi and Mumbai, marking progress in its strategy to enter India’s automotive market, reported Reuters.  
The US carmaker has been seeking showroom spaces since late last year, after pausing its market entry plans in 2022.  

                        The gold standard of business intelligence.

The selection of showroom spaces follows a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the US last week, where they discussed space, mobility, and technology.  
Tesla has secured a lease in the Aerocity area near New Delhi’s international airport, two anonymous sources familiar with the discussions told the news agency. 
Aerocity is known for its hotels, retail outlets, and global corporate offices.  
In Mumbai, Tesla has opted for space in the Bandra Kurla Complex, a business and retail hub near the city’s airport.  
Both showrooms will be approximately 5,000ft2 in size, as per the source. 
While opening dates for the showrooms are yet to be decided, Tesla plans to sell imported electric vehicles (EVs) in India.  
These locations are designated for showrooms, not service centres, and Tesla will manage the outlets.  
Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Additionally, Tesla has posted job advertisements for 13 mid-level positions in India, including store and customer relationship managers.  
Musk has previously criticised India’s high import tariffs of around 100% on EVs, which Tesla has lobbied to reduce. 
Local automakers have resisted Tesla’s entry, fearing it could impact their EV plans. Despite ongoing discussions, Tesla hesitated due to high import duties.  
Recently, India reduced its basic customs duty on vehicles priced above $40,000 from 110% to 70%. 
US President Donald Trump recently highlighted India’s high car duties but agreed with Modi to pursue an early trade deal to resolve tariff issues.  
Although India’s EV sector is smaller than China’s, it offers Tesla an opportunity amid declining sales, marking its first yearly drop in EV deliveries in over a decade.  
India recorded nearly 100,000 EV sales last year, while China achieved 11 million.

NEW YORK (AP) — The S&P 500 added to its record as U.S. stock indexes drifted through a quiet, mixed day on Wall Street. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% on Wednesday after setting an all-time high the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite inched up by 0.1%. Elon Musk’s Tesla was one of the strongest forces lifting the market. It helped offset a sharp drop for Celanese after the chemical company warned of weakness in some of its markets. Treasury yields eased a bit. Stock indexes fell in Europe after finishing mixed in Asia.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
NEW YORK (AP) — The S&P 500 is inching higher as U.S. stock indexes drift through a quiet Wednesday on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 was adding 0.3% to the all-time high it set the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually unchanged, with an hour of trading remaining, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% higher.
Elon Musk's Tesla was one of the strongest forces lifting the market, and it rose 2.3%. It climbed after another electric-vehicle company, Nikola, plunged 37.5% following its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The electric truck maker said it will try to sell off its assets and wind down its business.
A 9.6% rally for Analog Devices also helped push the S&P 500 higher. The semiconductor company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, despite what CEO Vincent Roche called a “challenging macro and geopolitical backdrop.”
They helped offset a 22.8% tumble for Celanese, which dropped even though the chemical company reported profit for the end of 2024 that topped analysts’ expectations. CEO Scott Richardson warned that it saw “demand deterioration that gave no sign of easing” during the last three months of the year, and the company expects weakness to continue for such core markets as automotive, construction and paints.
Toll Brothers, meanwhile, fell 5.7% after the homebuilder reported a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Douglas Yearley Jr. said this spring selling season has seen healthy demand so far for homes at the higher end of the price spectrum, but “affordability constraints” are hurting sales at the lower end.
A separate report on Wednesday morning said homebuilders as a group broke ground on fewer U.S. houses last month than economists expected.
High mortgage rates are making it difficult for some potential homebuyers to afford a house, even though the Federal Reserve began cutting its main interest rate in September in order to make things easier for the economy.
Mortgage rates have followed the trend of longer-term Treasury yields, which have remained relatively high in part because the U.S. economy has remained remarkably solid and because inflation hasn’t eased as much as hoped. Tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump, along with other policies that could put upward pressure on inflation, have also caused some sharp swings for yields in the bond market.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury stayed relatively calm Wednesday and edged down to 4.53% from 4.55% late Tuesday. It was below 3.70% as recently as September and approaching 4.80% within the past few weeks.
Both the bond and the stock markets have increasingly been taking Trump's tariffs in stride, after earlier showing much more trepidation. The hope on Wall Street is that Trump is using such threats merely as a tool to drive negotiations, and the ultimate effects won't be as bad as they initially appeared.
Such a calm response, though, could make things worse if conditions don't go as Wall Street expects, or if it emboldens Trump to make even more forceful actions.
For its part, the Federal Reserve has signaled it may make fewer cuts this year than earlier expected, in part because of worries that inflation will remain stubbornly above its 2% target. Cutting rates can boost the economy and juice prices for investments, but they can also give inflation more fuel.
Minutes released Wednesday for the Fed's last policy meeting in January showed officials discussed how Trump's proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, as well as strong consumer spending, could push inflation higher this year
In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.6% after a report showed U.K. inflation accelerated to a 10-month high. That could put pressure on the Bank of England, which had been cutting interest rates to invigorate its tepid economy.
Indexes fell more than 1% in other European markets, including in France and Germany, after finishing mixed across Asia. South Korea's Kospi jumped 1.7%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3%.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump has said that if Tesla were to build a factory in India to circumvent that country's tariffs, it would be ""unfair"" to the U.S., in an interview with Fox News which aired on Tuesday.
Trump called out India's high duty on cars during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the U.S. last week, but agreed to work towards an early trade deal and resolve their standoff over tariffs.
Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has long criticised India for having import tariffs of around 100% on EVs which protect local automakers such as Tata Motors in the world's third largest auto market, where EV adoption is still at a nascent stage.
Trump said it is ""impossible"" for Musk to sell a car in the South Asian nation.
""Every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs... It is impossible to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India,"" he said.
India's government in March unveiled a new EV policy lowering import taxes substantially to 15% if a carmaker invests at least $500 million and sets up a factory.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Tesla has selected locations for two showrooms in the Indian cities of New Delhi and Mumbai, and posted job ads for 13 mid-level roles in India. It does not currently manufacture any vehicles in India.
Trump said it would be ""unfair"" to the U.S. if Musk did decide to build a factory there.
""Now, if he built the factory in India, that's okay, but that's unfair to us. It's very unfair,"" Trump said in the interview.
India's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump's plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes U.S. imports have raised the risk of a global trade war with American friends and foes.

From the hotly-debated high-flier Tesla (TSLA), Wall Street’s newest darling Rivian (RIVN), traditional-stalwarts turned EV-upstarts GM (GM) and Ford (F) to the numerous SPAC-deal makers that have come public in this red-hot space, The Fly has you covered with “Charged,” a weekly recap of the top stories and expert calls in the sector.
AUTONOMOUS DRIVING LICENSE: Tesla is preparing for a potential delay in obtaining Chinese approval for its autonomous driving technology and the company has been told there is no definitive timetable for regulators to approve a license for it to begin widespread training of its “full self-driving” technology, despite an earlier indication that it would get the go ahead in the second quarter of 2025, people with knowledge of the matter told Financial Times‘ Zijing Wu and Stephen Morris.
GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES: Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg initiated coverage of Tesla with a Buy rating and $475 price target. In addition to continued proliferation of the electric vehicle market, Tesla has multiple opportunities to fuel growth, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, and energy generation/storage, the firm tells investors. Benchmark sees the release of more affordable Tesla models in 2025 as “a key catalyst for the stock,” adding that its model has only baked in vehicle growth, “providing significant potential upside should autonomous vehicles and Optimus achieve scale.”
HUMANOID ROBOTICS: Morgan Stanley notes Bloomberg reports that humanoid robot startup Figure AI is in talks to raise $1.5B in a deal that, if confirmed, would value the company at $39.5B. This would value Figure more than Ford and on par with Stellantis (STLA) and be a greater than 15 times increase in Figure’s valuation as the company was previously valued at $2.6B after a Series B funding round in February 2024 that was participated in by OpenAI, Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), the firm tells investors. Bloomberg also reports that Meta (META) is planning to form a new team to conduct work on humanoid robots, the analyst added. Morgan Stanley, which continues to view Tesla as “one of the leading enablers of humanoid robotics in the Western world,” anticipates growing investor interest in Tesla’s role in this potential “multi-trillion” addressable end-market and notes that its current valuation of Tesla does not factor in any value for Optimus. The firm keeps an Overweight rating and $430 price target on Tesla shares.
PLANS ON HOLD: The State Department said that it had put plans to buy armored electric vehicles on hold after reports that the $400M order would go to Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk is a close adviser of President Trump, reported The New York Times‘ Jack Ewing. “The solicitation is on hold, and there are no current plans to issue it,” the State Department is quoted as having said.

EV SALES TAX: A group of Senate Republicans proposed a $1,000 tax on new electric vehicle purchases to account for the cost of federal road repairs, David Shepardson of Reuters reports. The one-time $1,000 fee charged at the time of purchase would be roughly equivalent to what drivers of conventional vehicles pay in federal gas taxes over 10 years for highway funds, said Senator Deb Fischer, the lead sponsor of the measure. Electric vehicle carmakers include Tesla, Rivian Automotive, Lucid Group (LCID), Ford, General Motors, and Toyota (TM).
BUY LUCID: Benchmark initiated coverage of Lucid Group with a Buy rating and $5 price target. After a pause in 2024, domestic electric vehicle production is expected to improve in 2025 and further accelerate in 2026-27 as average selling prices decline and the charging infrastructure is built out, the firm tells investors. In that context, Benchmark views Lucid as “well positioned to achieve significant share of this burgeoning opportunity,” citing its technology, balance sheet, access to capital, Saudi investment, partnerships, “award-winning vehicles” and “highly integrated manufacturing capabilities,” the firm tells investors.

President Donald Trump proposed new 25% tariffs that could target semiconductor, automobile, and pharmaceutical imports into the US.
Lopez Research founder Maribel Lopez joins Morning Brief to highlight this as a starting point for negotiations, emphasizing that the actual tariff rate is yet to be determined. ""This is really an opening volley by Trump to say he's really serious about tariffs. Tariffs will happen. The amount of the tariff and what the negotiation standpoint is still unknown,"" Lopez explains.She highlights that industries like the automotive sector, with a strong US presence, may have a better chance of negotiating exemptions.

President Donald Trump threatening those levies of 25% or more on semiconductor imports. So joining us now with more on this, we got Maribel Lopez, the founder of Lopez Research. Maribel, it's great to have you on here. I want to talk specifically about the impact of these tariffs on some of these chips names, in particular that drove the market to all-time highs early this week. Is the market missing something sinister when it comes to tariffs, or is the market right to kind of be sloughing off any potential negative impact? 
This is really an opening volley by Trump to say he's really serious about tariffs. Tariffs will happen. The amount of the tariff and what the negotiation standpoint is is still unknown. So this is like, hey, I'm throwing it out there. You're going to come to me, we're going to have a negotiation, we're going to try to figure out how you were going to invest more in America. And that's really what I see as the statement that Trump is making here. This is why we're looking at April and not tomorrow. If we're looking at April, there's plenty of time for someone like TSMC to call and say, hey, here's how we're feeling about investing more in foundries in the US as an example. Same for Samsung and other companies that already build chips here, but not at a very significant standpoint. 
Are there industries that you think are more likely to be successful making sure that they're included in an exemptions or an exclusions list as they try to vie for the ear and and the mind of the President? 
So some companies actually already have a strong foothold. You mentioned the automotive industry. If you look at somebody like BMW, they already manufacture a significant portion of what they sell in the US, upwards of about 50% in the US. So they actually have a better negotiating ability than say Samsung who does manufacture some goods here, such as some of their home products, but not necessarily enough. So we're seeing that it is widely unevenly distributed across the various companies and across the various sectors. But I think the call to action for everybody right now is to try to figure out what they can do to make a play to say that they're going to invest in America to either create manufacturing jobs, to create investment in some other type of category that we would consider as beneficial to the economy. And this is why the fund managers are not overreacting to the statement at this point because they understand at this moment, it's still a negotiation. 
So it sounds like you think the market is right to view this as that negotiation, not as something more serious. But do you think that the Trump administration is kind of angling towards universal tariffs by throwing out these larger numbers, like a 25% to kick off those negotiations, and could there be risk associated with that? 
I think they're incredibly serious about tariffs across the board. I think this is definitely a statement that says, no industry, no country will remain unscathed by tariffs, and that you have to have a plan on how to work with us. We are serious about rebalancing, whatever they think rebalancing means, but they have definitely indicated that they are serious about it. So the real thing to watch here to your earlier point is, when do they come in effect, how long do we expect them to be in effect, and what would be considered a sufficient and necessary investment in the US. But clearly, there are many companies that are looking at this saying, if you were a auto manufacturer, say in Japan, if you are a semiconductor manufacturer in Taiwan, you're looking at, what could this do to my profitability? How do I find a way to make sure that there's a sufficient investment that we don't end up with a 25% tariff, which is a significant number for any company.

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) secured showroom locations in New Delhi and Mumbai as it moves ahead with plans to enter the Indian market.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.
With no imminent plans for service facilities, the developer of electric cars is concentrating on retail environments.
Tesla has chosen a location in the Aerocity region of New Delhi, a commercial center close to the international airport that contains corporate offices, hotels, and retail stores. The firm has decided on a site in Bandra Kurla Complex, a big commercial and retail area close to the airport in Mumbai. Every showroom is supposed to be around 5,000 square feet (464.52 square meters).
For its operations in India, Tesla has also started recruiting; it has posted job ads for 13 mid-level positions including store and customer relations managers.
The company's arrival into India coincides with government obstacles like hefty import taxes on electric cars. India levies almost perfect import taxes, a policy Tesla has attacked. Citing rivalry, domestic manufacturers have also rebelled against Tesla's entrance. Leaders from both nations have agreed to pursue a trade agreement that would affect auto taxes, therefore addressing the problem via U.S.-India trade negotiations.
Originally postponing its intentions for development in India until 2022, Tesla began its hunt for showroom space in late 2023. Though it has not yet stated the opening date for the additional sites, the firm keeps advancing with its market launch.

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have Elon Musk's fortune? A new website lets you do just that—at least hypothetically. With an estimated net worth of $398 billion, according to Bloomberg, Musk remains the richest person in the world. Now, thanks to an online tool, anyone can attempt to “spend” his wealth on everything from AirPods to mega yachts, and the results are staggering.
The website Spend-elon-fortune.com starts by giving you an imaginary bank account filled with Musk's estimated wealth. Users can go on a virtual shopping trip, picking things like video game systems, private islands, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) robots, and even an NFL team, which costs about $3 billion.

The website recently went viral on Reddit, where thousands of users tried their hand at spending Musk's wealth. One person said they “bought everything they realistically wanted” and barely cracked $2 billion. Another user joked, “I barely cracked $300 million, and I bought the entire Senate.” Some attempted to give away large sums, but even donating $10,000 to 5,000 people only accounted for $50 million, a tiny fraction of the total.
Many users pointed out how absurd it is for one person to control that much wealth.

The exercise is fun, but it also highlights the massive scale of wealth inequality. Some Reddit users suggested that the website should include options like “end world hunger” or “fund universal healthcare” to see how many global issues could be solved with Musk's fortune.
Musk's fortune fluctuates daily, largely due to the performance of Tesla stock, which makes up a significant portion of his net worth. Earlier this month, his fortune dipped below $400 billion for the first time this year due to a drop in Tesla’s stock price, but it quickly rebounded.
While most of us will never have anywhere near Musk's level of wealth, this website provides an eye-opening look at just how much money he has. Whether you want to fund startups, buy an entire fleet of private jets, or just stack up on PlayStation 5s, it turns out that even spending hundreds of billions of dollars is no easy feat.

A federal judge just handed a temporary win to Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), denying an emergency bid to block their access to federal data systems and workforce cuts. Judge Tanya Chutkan acknowledged concerns over Musk's sweeping authority but ruled that the states hadn't proven immediate harm. The lawsuit, filed by multiple attorneys general, argues that Musk's role bypasses the Constitution's Appointments Clause, which requires Senate confirmation. While this ruling keeps DOGE's mandate intact for now, legal battles are far from over, and investors should watch how this fight unfolds.
Under Musk's leadership, DOGE has aggressively slashed government jobs and dismantled key programs, sparking major legal and political scrutiny. Critics argue these rapid moves are destabilizing critical state-run initiatives and federal operations. While some courts have temporarily restricted DOGE's access to Treasury systems, others have allowed it to continue accessing internal databases. The mixed rulings highlight the ongoing uncertainty around Musk's government influence, and markets tied to federal contracts and regulatory oversight could see increased volatility in the near term.
Musk's deepening role in federal operations adds another layer of risk for investors, particularly those with stakes in companies reliant on government policy. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX, both helmed by Musk, might face heightened regulatory scrutiny as the legal drama intensifies. Meanwhile, states pushing back against DOGE's influence could create further disruptions, amplifying unpredictability for industries linked to federal spending. With multiple lawsuits still in play, investors should brace for more twists in this unprecedented battle over Musk's government footprint.

Tesla,2025-02-19,The one thing Elon Musk doesn't tweet about: Tariffs,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d62e7062e4802be9616e81381fad59465ba88895f1b7febf8863d4b9132b7dfd,Elon Musk posts a lot but one subject was glaringly absent in recent weeks: President Donald Trump's tariff plans.,"Oops, something went wrong
Elon Musk undoubtedly tweets a lot, recently offering about 270 posts, reposts, or comments to his X platform during the 24 hours of Presidents' Day. It was an average day for him.
But one subject has been glaringly absent in spite of Musk's 10+ post-per-hour velocity in the early weeks of Trump 2.0: the president's tariff plans.
In fact, a variety of searches of Musk's posting history using the X search engine for terms like ""tariff"" or ""import duty"" revealed minimal to no results. And when the topic does pop up, it's invariably in a post that is years old and sounds very different from how Donald Trump talks about the issue today.
At one point in 2018, Musk even directed a message at Trump during his first term by saying, ""I am against import duties in general,"" as he also agreed with Trump's general objection to foreign duties on cars.
More recently, the tariff mentions from Musk appear to have dropped to zero. A Yahoo Finance review of many of Musk's tweets in recent weeks couldn't find a single direct mention by Musk, one way or the other, on tariffs.
Plenty of recent posts have praised Trump's agenda in broad terms but without noting tariffs specifically.
But that doesn't mean tariffs have necessarily been far from Musk's mind — or that Trump's trade agenda couldn't end up helping Musk's business interests depending on how it shakes out.
It's a dynamic that underlines how Musk, in addition to his role as ""first buddy"" and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), also remains the CEO of multiple companies that could stand to gain or lose profits.
The tension was perhaps on no starker display than when Musk — who is also the Tesla (TSLA) CEO — met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a visit to Washington last week as EV tariffs from that country sit as a key agenda item.
Trump recently announced a plan for reciprocal tariffs as his administration launches negotiations on a one-by-one basis with nations that could be impacted. Talks with India are already underway to determine whether Trump can force Modi's government to lower duties on things like EVs (which could clearly help a company like Tesla) or whether reciprocal tariffs will mean hikes in duties from both sides.
Read more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?
Musk's rare discussions of tariffs online over the years have often touched on reciprocity primarily as a means to drive down duties. At one point in 2020, he noted of the US/UK trading relationship that the ideal is ""no tariffs at all either way.""
Trump has clearly offered a very different public message. He often touts the duties as good for their own sake and as a way to raise revenue.
Just on Tuesday afternoon, the president told reporters he is looking at auto tariffs ""in the neighborhood of 25%"" and that he plans to announce them around April 2. He added that new duties on semiconductors and pharmaceutical products are also in the offing.
Trump has also implemented new 10% tariffs on China with many others threatened to go into effect in the coming weeks and months.
Musk's public stance is similar to certain other Republicans who tend to lean in a free trade direction but, for now, are content to keep their objections to Trump's trade war plans at a low volume or muted completely.
And the tariff topic clearly hasn't dampened Musk's enthusiasm for Trump and his agenda, as was in evidence when the two men sat for a warm joint interview on Fox News (where the topic of tariffs never came up) and in a memorable recent post from Musk, reading, ""I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man.""
But his relative public silence on tariffs — and possible behind the scenes maneuvering in the case of India — has become one of many criticisms lobbed at Musk from his political opponents.
Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, recently blasted Musk's meeting with Modi by charging that Musk was sitting in a formal government setting ""for concessions that would make him rich"" — calling it ""shameless corruption at a scale never seen before in our history.""
A summary of the meeting from Modi said the conversation touched on a variety of topics including ""furthering ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance.’""
But whether Musk is pushing in different directions in his role as a CEO versus that of a government employee is a topic that apparently isn't overly concerning to Trump.
The president was recently asked by reporters whether Musk approached his meeting with Modi as a CEO or as a White House adviser. Trump said he didn't know.
""I assume he wants to do business in India, but India's a very hard place to do business in because of the tariffs,"" Trump added.
""You could call him an employee, you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want,"" Trump added as he weighed in on the topic again this week.
But one area of Musk's previously expressed views on tariffs may have resonated with Trump.
Musk has posted multiple times in recent years about the impact that local value-added taxes (VATs) have on the varying prices of Tesla cars.
""Prices in the US (of all goods) don't include VAT, but it's usually included in other countries,"" Musk noted in 2021.
Trump recently announced his plan for reciprocal tariffs with a memo that offered a specific discussion of how non-tariff barriers like a VAT would be part of the reciprocity conversation.
""For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff,"" Trump noted on Truth Social.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who serves on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the President Donald Trump administration sparked a discussion about Social Security Administration (SSA) data accuracy on Tuesday, sharing statistics showing millions of Americans over 100 years old listed as alive in the system.
What Happened: University of Michigan economics professor Justin Wolfers provided context, citing a July 2023 SSA Inspector General audit report that identified approximately 18.9 million number holders born before 1920 without death information in their records.
The audit report revealed that 98% of these cases receive no payments, with the anomaly largely attributed to pre-electronic record-keeping era deaths. The SSA has declined previous recommendations to update these records, citing implementation costs between $5-10 million and limited benefit to current programs.

“Should government databases be cleaner? It’s a cost-benefit question,” Wolfers noted on X, suggesting the issue might not be a major concern given the low rate of active payments.
Musk, who shared age distribution data showing over 4.7 million individuals aged 100-109 in the system, responded with humor, referencing the “Twilight” vampire series and suggesting supernatural explanations for the longevity statistics.

Trending: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?
Why It Matters: The discussion comes amid broader concerns about federal data management. The SSA has defended its position, arguing that updating non-beneficiary records would divert resources from current operations. The agency maintains that other entities can independently assess presumed death based on age.
The debate highlights ongoing challenges in modernizing legacy government systems while balancing resource allocation and operational priorities. Despite the apparent discrepancies, the audit confirms that actual improper payments remain minimal among these historical records.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other AI stocks.
Tiger Brokers, an online brokerage firm, has recently revealed that it has embedded DeepSeek's model into its AI-powered chatbot. The DeepSeek-R1 model integrated into TigerGPT signifies a strategic move made by the firm to enhance the platform’s capabilities and user experience. The move comes amid brokerages and money managers racing to leverage the start-up's artificial intelligence breakthrough.

Other Chinese brokers and fund managers who have integrated DeepSeek’s model include Sinolink Securities, CICC Wealth Management, and China Universal Asset Management. Their integrations have allowed them to radicalize how they conduct research, manage risks, make investment decisions, and even interact with clients.
The R1 model will allow Tiger Brokers to help customers analyze valuations, and make trading decisions and as Wu Tianhua, Tiger Brokers' founder and CEO puts it, ""feel the beauty of investment”, all by tapping on their financial data.
""Its impact is real. It's no longer a concept, or a marketing trick,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Chinese firms may be integrating DeepSeek fast into their operations, but tech firms in the US are racing hard to develop their own. In the latest news, Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI has revealed the Grok-3 model, a version of its chatbot that is launched to rival OpenAI merely days after Musk’s unsolicited cash bid to buy the company was rejected.
Grok-3 is available to Premium+ subscribers on X. The service costs $22 a month. In comparison, full access to OpenAI’s GPT-4o costs $200 a month. xAI has also revealed its plans to start a new subscription called SuperGrok for the bot’s mobile app and Grok.com website. Bloomberg reported that xAI plans to open-source preceding versions of Grok models as soon as the latest one is fully mature. This move coincides with similar ones made by other AI firms after the launch of DeepSeek’s AI models, reflecting a broader AI trend toward transparency and collaboration.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On February 18, analyst Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock and kept the price target at $430.00.
Tesla’s strategic positioning in the automotive and technology sectors, particularly its focus on innovation and leadership in electric vehicles (EVs), has led to the rating. Moreover, the company’s ability to integrate cutting-edge technology and sustainable energy solutions, strong financial performance, and expanding production capabilities make the investment particularly appealing. In addition, Tesla is expanding in autonomous driving technology and energy storage solutions, which further enhances its long-term prospects.
“We continue to view Tesla as one of the leading enablers of humanoid robotics in the Western world and anticipate growing investor interest in TSLA’s role in this potential multi-trillion TAM end-market”.
Overall TSLA ranks 5th on our list of the buzzing AI stocks dominating headlines. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Tesla,2025-02-19,Is Tesla suffering from Musk’s politics in Europe?,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=269b6d9b97f5b44467c5516de4276f4f5b349f17ad60aed0d5f82d2418a8936d,Tesla sales have declined rapidly as Elon Musk’s political links to Donald Trump have become more pronounced. Have Musk’s political endeavours had a negative impact on Tesla?,"Tesla sales have declined rapidly as Elon Musk’s political links to Donald Trump have become more pronounced. Have Musk’s political endeavours had a negative impact on Tesla?
In January 2025, there were a record number of electric vehicle (EV) registrations in the UK, Europe’s largest battery-electric market, according to data from New Automotive. Yet Tesla’s UK sales declined 12% from the previous year in January 2025, dropping from 1,604 registrations to 1,416. Tesla suffered its first-ever annual decline in deliveries in 2024 despite being the leading EV seller in the US and the largest car company in the world by market capitalization. Overall, 2025 global Tesla sales in January were down a massive 50.4% YoY.
Europe seems like an especially painful region for the automotive company, as in January 2025 German sales dropped 60% on the previous year, French sales dropped 63%, Spanish sales dropped 75% YoY, and Dutch sales dropped 42.5% YoY.

                                    The gold standard of business intelligence.
                                

                                        Find out more
                                        




Overall, Tesla’s European sales in January 2025 were down 48% on the same period of the previous year. Tesla isn’t fully at fault for this slump, given that 2024 European battery-electric vehicle registrations fell 27% in comparison to 2023, according to GlobalData. The European EV market has certainly shrunk, yet Tesla is shrinking far more than expected. Tesla is still selling thousands of cars, but they’re selling far fewer than they did this time last year.
Since acquiring Twitter (now X) in 2022, Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, has become more vocal on political issues. Over the last year, the tech billionaire has involved himself in far-right European politics. Has this contributed to declining Tesla sales in the region?
The past five years have been a political adventure
Once a beloved champion of environmental capitalism, Musk has gone from the center-left of the political spectrum to a position firmly on the right. Musk voted for Democratic candidates in US elections between 2008 and 2020, according to the billionaire, only switching to Republican in 2024. Since endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in July 2024, he has donated over $200 million to the Trump cause, with Trump gifting him the unofficial position of head of the department of government efficiency (DOGE).
In recent months, Musk has turned his attention to Europe. In January 2025, he appeared at election campaign events held by Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), a party that advocates for the resettlement of people with a migrant background. As German Tesla sales drop by 60%, Schmidt Automotive Research has said that German EV buyers “may well be reacting to Musk’s comments” at the AfD rally. As Musk’s political actions become seen as more extreme (or at least off the mainstream), Europeans’ interest in Tesla may decrease even more. 
Intensifying competition, aging product lineup, regulatory pressures
However, there are other reasons why Tesla sales are slumping. Chinese companies like BYD, Chery, and Geely are producing new, cheap models that are gaining market share in Europe. These companies are also constructing or have already constructed facilities in Europe. BYD has an $8.2 billion battery plant in Hungary and Chery has a production facility in Spain. BYD saw a 550% increase in UK registrations in 2024.
Tesla’s lineup is also, by most accounts, getting a bit stale. No new model has been introduced in Europe since the Model Y in 2021. A refresh of the Model Y is set to come out in mid-2025, which might be another reason why consumers are holding off on buying a new Tesla. Musk’s next project, an autonomous vehicle, is unlikely to pass strict European regulations. Tesla also has a low number of cars in stock at this time of the year as Musk’s company typically pushes sales in Q4 to boost end-of-year sales.
In conclusion
Ultimately, a January slump in Tesla sales was expected. The European EV market is contracting, Tesla’s lineup is stale, its inventory is low, and foreign competition is increasing dramatically. Nor is Tesla giving up market share without a fight. It is updating the Model Y, expanding its gigafactory in Berlin, and investing in supercharger network growth. However, this might not be enough, and Musk’s political stances have clearly affected consumer sentiment. Even in the US, specifically California, Musk’s company saw sales contract by 12% in 2024.
Tesla is at an inflection point in its history. Its CEO is standing shoulder to shoulder with the most powerful man in the world, yet faces slumping sales in his largest business. The first six months of 2025 will be definitive for Tesla as it tries to combat market competition, its worsening image in Europe, and consumer sentiment. Tesla’s image may soon become irreparably damaged on the continent. Musk is closely linked with Donald Trump, and the US president is not popular in Europe; only 22% of Europeans polled thinking that Trump as the president will be a good thing according to a survey from the European Council on Foreign Relations (EFCR) in January 2025. Trump is also not a fan of Europe, calling it a “mini-China” and threatening the European Union with tariffs. 
In contrast to Tesla’s struggles, Musk’s other main business interests (X and SpaceX) stand to benefit from his proximity to Trump through government contracts and increased social media traffic. Tesla is far more dependent on consumer sentiment and fluctuating demand than X and SpaceX. This is not the end for Tesla in Europe, but the coming months will indicate the scale of the challenge it faces in the region.

Key Points
Viking Global Investors' billionaire chief kicked Tesla to the curb in the December-ended quarter in favor of an industry-leading company with phenomenal subscription pricing power.
Important data releases aren't hard to come by on Wall Street. Every week, investors are privy to economic data and quarterly operating results from some of America's most-influential businesses. But Friday, Feb. 14, was a particularly special day for investors -- and it has nothing to do with Valentine's Day.
No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F offers a snapshot that allows investors to see which stocks Wall Street's leading money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter. February 14 marked the deadline for 13Fs to be filed for the December-ended quarter.

Although Warren Buffett rightly garners a lot of interest, he's far from the only billionaire asset manager that makes waves on Wall Street. Smart investors also pay close attention to billionaire Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors, who closed out 2024 with $30.9 billion in AUM spread across 86 stocks.
Halvorsen and his team run an active fund, with the average holding length of Viking Global's top-20 positions coming in at less than one year. This makes his buying and selling decisions all the more intriguing for everyday investors.
During the fourth quarter, Halvorsen sent shares of North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker packing, and more than doubled his fund's stake in a high-flying company that may be Wall Street's next stock-split stock.
Though Halvorsen completely exited more than one dozen positions during the December-ended quarter, perhaps none stands out more than selling all 436,272 shares of EV maker Tesla (TSLA -5.49%), which was a position worth more than $114 million, as of Sept. 30.
A lot has gone right for Tesla, as evidenced by its inclusion in the ""Magnificent Seven."" It's became the first automaker in more than a half-century to build itself from the ground up to mass production, and recently reported its fifth consecutive year of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit.
Additionally, CEO Elon Musk is attempting to spread Tesla's wings beyond the traditional (and highly cyclical) auto industry. The company's rapidly growing energy generation and storage segment, coupled with its Supercharger network, may be able to smooth out some of the cyclical ebb-and-flow that can affect auto stocks.
Selling Viking Global Investors' stake in Tesla might represent nothing more than simple profit-taking. Following Donald Trump's November victory, shares of Tesla skyrocketed up to 91% in six weeks. The return of Trump to the White House has been viewed as a positive for Tesla, with Musk working as a special government employee for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
But there may be other more nefarious reasons why Viking Global's billionaire chief chose to kick Tesla to the curb.
To begin with, Tesla's vehicle margin has plummeted due to growing competition and waning demand for EVs. Since the start of 2023, Tesla slashed the price for its fleet of EVs (Models 3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions. While this has helped to reduce inventory a bit in recent quarters, it's decimated the company's vehicle margin and weighed heavily on its profits.
There's also the obvious concern that Elon Musk is spending most of his time overseeing DOGE instead of running Tesla. Tesla's otherworldly valuation premium derives, in part, from investors believing in Musk's vision for the future. Distractions like DOGE may cause Tesla to fall short of various growth expectations.
Another potential issue is that Tesla generates a sizable percentage of its net income from unsustainable and non-innovative sources. More than half of the company's 2024 pre-tax profit could be traced back to regulatory automotive credits, interest income earned on its cash, and digital asset value adjustments -- Tesla holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The point being that Tesla's operations aren't responsible for the lion's share of its profit.
Lastly, Halvorsen might be concerned with Musk's inability to meet deadlines and hold true to his promises. Many of Musk's promises, such as robotaxis and Level 5 full self-driving (FSD), are already baked into Tesla's valuation. However, Tesla is nowhere close to L5 FSD, and it hasn't put a single robotaxi on public roads. If these unfulfilled promises were backed out of Tesla's market cap, a case can be made that its share price would plunge.

On the other end of the spectrum, Ole Andreas Halvorsen was mashing the buy button during the fourth quarter to add to Viking Global's position in streaming-services provider Netflix (NFLX -2.60%). Halvorsen oversaw the purchase of 297,317 shares of Netflix stock, which increase his fund's stake by a cool 145% from Sept. 30.
Why Netflix? For one, it's the undisputed leader in streaming services. It ended 2024 with 301.63 million global streaming paid memberships and is one of a select few streaming providers that's shown it's recurringly profitable.
To build on this point, streaming net additions have, for the most part, reaccelerated. The 18.91 million paid net additions during the fourth quarter represents the biggest quarterly increase in years, and it firmly puts a short-lived period of paid-member growth stagnation from 2022 in the rearview mirror.
One of the key catalysts behind Netflix's rapidly growing subscriber base is its content library. More specifically, Netflix has produced more original shows than any other streaming platform. Shows like Squid Game, Wednesday, and Stranger Things are helping to keep members loyal to Netflix, as well as luring in new subscribers.
The company's efforts to crack down on password sharing have also been a positive. Requiring users to create accounts has juiced the company's paid membership, as well as increased Netflix's subscription-pricing power. Last month, Netflix announced it would be increasing subscriptions by $1 to $2.50 per month, depending on the tier.
Adding to this long list of catalysts, Netflix is benefiting from its out-of-the-box innovation. The introduction of an ad-supported tier in November 2022 appears to have kick-started a resurgence in new member additions. Since Netflix's ad tier debuted, it's picked up 70 million paying subscribers.
Ole Andreas Halvorsen might also be counting on stock-split euphoria to take shape. Netflix stock ended Feb. 14 at $1,058.60 per share. The last time the company conducted a forward stock split was in 2015, with its shares trading for around $700 at the time. A quadruple-digit share price might make it difficult for Netflix to appeal to everyday investors -- especially those who can't purchase fractional shares with their broker.
Based on an analysis from Bank of America Global Research, companies conducting forward splits have handily outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 in the 12 months following their split announcement, with an average gain of 25.4% compared to 11.9% for the S&P 500 since 1980.  Considering how pricey Netflix stock is amid an already expensive stock market, a split announcement could go a long way to powering its shares even higher.

Key Points
If you're a fan of Westerns, you may think of the silver screen when someone says The Magnificent Seven -- a film by the name came out in 1960. But the name also refers to a group of stocks that have powered index gains through this bull market so far. Each of these companies is involved in the industry of technology, and they also have invested in the hottest tech area of all in recent times: artificial intelligence (AI).
These seven players have seen their shares climb along with revenue -- and investors are generally optimistic about these companies' long-term prospects too. After this top performance, with most Magnificent Seven players advancing in the double digits over the past year, you may expect their valuations to be sky-high. But that isn't necessarily the case. Let's meet the cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven right now -- and consider whether it's a buy.
Image source: Getty Images.
First, though, a quick look at the members of this elite list of movers. And they are: Alphabet (GOOG -3.23%) (GOOGL -3.17%), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Each of these stocks, except Microsoft, has climbed in the double digits over the past year. This is as investors piled into companies developing or using AI products and services with the idea that this technology could generate explosive growth over time.
Some of these players already are seeing the benefits. For example, Nvidia, the top maker of AI chips, has seen revenue climb in the double or triple digits quarter after quarter. And Amazon, the world's top cloud services provider, says its cloud unit already is delivering an annual revenue run rate of $115 billion thanks to its AI offerings.
Now, let's turn to the question of valuations. Certain members of the Magnificent Seven trade at levels some investors may consider high -- such as Tesla, trading for more than 120 times forward earnings estimates. But one particular Magnificent Seven stock, in spite of climbing 31% over the past year, today trades for only 20 times forward earnings estimates -- the cheapest of the group by this measure.
I'm talking about Alphabet, owner of the world's most popular search engine, Google, and the high-growth cloud services provider, Google Cloud. Though Alphabet's stock has climbed, earnings too have advanced recently and over the long term. This is thanks to the company's dominance in search and the fact that this leads to strong revenue growth -- advertisers pay to advertise their products and services across Google, where they know they can easily reach us.
Though Alphabet dominates the search market, with about 90% share, and has proved its ability to grow revenue over time, the company hasn't been sitting still. Instead, it's invested heavily in AI -- and continues to do so -- to boost its future revenue opportunities. Alphabet's large language model, Gemini, is used across its business, from improving search results and the advertising experience for advertisers to serving the customers of its cloud business.
In the recent quarter, Alphabet said demand for its AI services is growing, with cloud customers using more than eight times the compute capacity for tasks like training and inferencing than they did a year and a half ago. The company continues to increase investment in AI so that it can serve increasing demand. It announced $75 billion in capital spending for this year to support technical infrastructure such as servers, data centers, and networking.
This spending may not please investors right at this moment, but it's important to look at the situation through a long-term lens. Today's $200 billion AI market is expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade, and companies that position themselves well now are most likely to benefit. So I see Alphabet's move as a wise one from that perspective.
One element that may weigh on Alphabet is its ongoing antitrust battle. A U.S. district judge ruled last year that Alphabet has illegally used its search position to crush competition -- but the company plans to appeal, and considering past antitrust cases in the field, I'm not overly worried about the final outcome.
Now, let's get back to our question: Alphabet is the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven now. But is it a buy? I say yes. Even though the antitrust case may represent some headwinds, overall, Alphabet's leadership in its markets, its earnings track record, and its future prospects thanks to smart AI investment and innovation make me optimistic about the company -- and stock performance over the long term.

(Reuters) -     Amazon said on Wednesday it will exclusively stream 21 New York Yankees regular games on its Prime Video service for the upcoming 2025 season, as streaming companies face increasing competition to broadcast live sporting events.
The baseball games will be live streamed at no extra cost to Prime Video members living in New York State, Connecticut, north and central New Jersey and northeast Pennsylvania -- areas that cover a majority of the fanbase of the New York Yankees.
Live sports, a prerogative of cable television for decades, is swiftly moving to digital platforms to tap the larger audience that is ditching cable TV subscriptions for digital streaming platforms.
Streaming bellwether Netflix has increased its investments towards acquiring live sports content, including high-profile events such as the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match, aiming to diversify its portfolio and attract a broader audience.
It also paid more than $5 billion to be the exclusive home of World Wrestling Entertainment's Raw in several territories from January this year and is considering a bid for Formula 1's U.S. TV rights, according to media reports.
This has prompted competing digital platforms, including Prime Video, to stream more live sporting events to drive subscriber growth and enhance their advertising revenue, as live events tend to draw large, engaged audiences.
Prime Video currently streams the NBA, Thursday Night Football, NASCAR, Seattle Kraken and Overtime Elite among others in the U.S.

Published: 2025-02-26 04:21:13 ET

DBRS Limited (Morningstar DBRS) confirmed its credit ratings on the following classes of Amazon Seattle Loan-Specific Certificates issued by Benchmark 2021-B25 Mortgage Trust.
Class 300P-A at A (high) (sf)
Class 300P-B at BBB (high) (sf)
Class 300P-C at BB (sf)
Class 300P-D at B (sf)
Class 300P-E at B (low) (sf)
Class 300P-RR at B (low) (sf)
All trends are Stable.
The credit rating confirmations reflect the stable performance of the underlying collateral, which remains in line with Morningstar DBRS' expectations at the last credit rating action in April 2024. The Amazon Seattle Loan-Specific Certificates are secured by the fee-simple interest in a Class A office property known as Amazon Seattle, as well as its leasehold interest in a parking lease covering certain spaces at an adjacent parking garage. Amazon Seattle is a redeveloped Class A office building in the heart of the Seattle central business district and consists of approximately 680,000 square feet (sf) of office space and 94,000 sf of retail space. The $455 million whole loan is composed of $234.9 million of senior A notes, one junior B note of $155.1 million (the Amazon Seattle Trust Subordinate Companion Loan), and a mezzanine loan of $65 million. The Amazon Loan-Specific Certificates total $155.1 million and are collateralized by only the Amazon Seattle Trust Subordinate Companion Loan. The interest-only loan is structured with an anticipated repayment date in April 2030 and a final maturity date in May 2033.
The property was originally constructed in 1929 as the flagship location of prominent Seattle-based department store The Bon Marche and has since been granted landmark status by the city of Seattle. In 2017, the previous owner began a three-phase, comprehensive transformation to convert the property into office space for Amazon. The previous owner completed the first two phases of the project at a cost of $160.0 million and the final phase of the repositioning project, Amazon's final expansion and conversion, was completed and all of Amazon's space was delivered by February 2022 in accordance with the loan agreement.
According to the September 2024 rent roll, the property is 94.6% leased to four tenants. The office component of the collateral is fully occupied by investment-grade tenant Amazon (88.3% of the net rentable area) on a triple net lease that extends through May 2033, with three five-year renewal options available. There are no future termination options or outs in the lease. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the Amazon lease is guaranteed by the parent company, Amazon.com, Inc., however, the guarantee cap amount is scheduled to reduce each year until the lease's initial expiry in 2033. Although the site inspection dated August 2024 noted that physical occupancy at the office was approximately 10% given work-from-home flexibility, as per recent media articles, Amazon revised its return to office mandate to five-days per week beginning in January 2025, marking a significant increase in foot traffic in downtown Seattle since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Reis, office properties within the Central Seattle submarket reported an average vacancy rate of 21.0% in Q4 2024, a slight increase from 20.0% in Q4 2023; however, the five-year forecasted vacancy rate is expected to decrease to 15.3%. Despite the softening submarket metrics, Amazon has demonstrated its commitment to the property by completing various amenity projects during the pandemic to revitalize the space. As per the financial statement for the trailing-six-month period ended June 30, 2024, the annualized net cash flow (NCF) was reported at $26.8 million, lower than the Morningstar DBRS NCF of $29.0 million, which applies straight-line credit to Amazon's rent over the loan term given its consideration as a long-term credit tenant.
The April 2024 Morningstar DBRS credit rating analysis and action included an updated collateral valuation. For more information regarding the approach and analysis conducted, please refer to the press release titled 'Morningstar DBRS Takes Rating Actions on North American Single-Asset/Single-Borrower Transactions Backed by Office Properties,' published on April 15, 2024. Morningstar DBRS maintained the valuation approach from the April 2024 review, which was based on a capitalization rate of 7.50% applied to the Morningstar DBRS net cash flow of $29.0 million. Morningstar DBRS also maintained positive qualitative adjustments to the loan-to-value ratio sizing benchmarks totaling 6.0% to reflect the subject property's quality and generally long-term in-place tenancy of the investment-grade tenant. The Morningstar DBRS concluded value of $386.9 million represents a -39.9% variance from the issuance appraised value of $644.0 million.
Morningstar DBRS' credit ratings on the applicable classes address the credit risk associated with the identified financial obligations in accordance with the relevant transaction documents. Where applicable, a description of these financial obligations can be found in the transactions' respective press releases at issuance.
Morningstar DBRS' long-term credit ratings provide opinions on risk of default. Morningstar DBRS considers risk of default to be the risk that an issuer will fail to satisfy the financial obligations in accordance with the terms under which a long-term obligation has been issued. The Morningstar DBRS short-term debt rating scale provides an opinion on the risk that an issuer will not meet its short-term financial obligations in a timely manner.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS
There were no Environmental/Social/Governance factors that had a significant or relevant effect on the credit analysis.

AMZN

(Reuters) -European satellite company SES beat annual core profit estimates on Wednesday, helped by strong commercial activity even as it faces stiff competition from new players offering an alternative to traditional satellite service providers.
Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew slightly to 1.03 billion euros ($1.08 billion) in 2024, while analysts had expected it to drop to 994 million euros, a survey compiled by the company showed.
Already buried under billions of euros of debt, Europe's legacy satellite operators are being challenged by the rising popularity of Elon Musk's Starlink and Amazon's Kuiper.
Unlike Starlink's 7,000 low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites bringing internet access to consumers, SES manages a multi-orbit network of around 70 geostationary (GEO) and medium Earth orbit(MEO) satellites that provide connectivity for a wide range of markets including aviation, maritime, military and governments.
SES said its acquisition of Intelsat, announced last year, was on track to be completed in the second half of 2025 after receiving regulatory clearances.
The Luxembourg-based satellite operator also forecast stable growth for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA in 2025.
SPECTRUM OPPORTUNITIES
SES has made billions of euros in recent years through its C-band clearing activities in the U.S. and may benefit from new openings after acquiring Intelsat.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission will decide on Thursday whether it will move forward with plans to free up new spectrum.
C-band is a segment of the spectrum used by satellite service providers to broadcast video and radio content to 120 million households in the United States.
SES and Intelsat have historically been the largest holders of these coveted frequencies, instrumental in 5G deployment, accounting for more than 90% of the services provided.
However, their leadership in the market could be diminished due to emerging competitors such as Musk's Space X.
In January, Space X's vice president of satellite policy, David Goldman, suggested in a letter to FCC Secretary Marlene Dortch that the C-band should be shared among other players after the SES-Intelsat merger.

AMZN

For years, the Northern District of Illinois (NDIL) has been the leading venue for design patent owners seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief against numerous merchants in a single litigation (the so-called ""Schedule A"" cases) for sales of allegedly infringing products on e-commerce platforms, frequently shipped out from locations in mainland China to retail buyers in the United States (including goods available for delivery to Illinois). Federal judges in NDIL routinely find personal jurisdiction over these defendants based on sales that can be (or are) directed to consumers located in the district. The district court regularly accepts the patentee's boilerplate arguments about the court's jurisdiction over the online storefront operators, anchored in language like:
Defendants have targeted sales to Illinois residents by setting up and operating e-commerce stores that target United States consumers using one or more Seller Aliases, offer shipping to the United States, including Illinois, accept payment in U.S. dollars and/or funds from U.S. bank accounts, and, on information and belief, have sold products featuring [patentee's] patented design to residents of Illinois.1
However, the reverse—when the would-be infringer initiates to lawsuit to have its rights adjudicated in NDIL—is not always true, because the courts may decline to find personal jurisdiction over the patent owner in the same type of online commercial dispute. A pair of recent rulings from the district bear this out, highlighting potential asymmetrical treatment of accused infringers and rights-holders in the busiest Schedule A forum in the country.
In Zhifu Network Technology Co., Ltd (Shenzhen) v. Core Home Fitness, LLC, Case No. 1:24-cv-11277, a Chinese company (patent challenger) that was prevented from selling its dumbbell weights on Amazon.com nationwide (including in Illinois) sued the patentee, an out-of-state company that also marketed and offered competing products for sale to Illinois, which had filed complaints with Amazon that triggered delisting of the plaintiff's products. To establish the court's personal jurisdiction over the patentee, the patent challenger's Complaint used nearly identical language as that quoted above, referencing the patentee's targeting of business activities towards consumers in Illinois via its e-commerce store, etc., but in its February 5, 2025 ruling the court dismissed the patent challenger's suit for lack of personal jurisdiction over the patentee and improper venue. The Zhifu court reasoned that the patentee's having ""complain[ed] to Amazon"" from another state—thereby causing Amazon to delist the plaintiff's product globally—was too attenuated to show the patentee ""purposefully directed"" its activities at Illinois (without which, being forced to defend the lawsuit in NDIL would violate Constitutional Due Process safeguards).
Contemporaneously, in Aixining Trading Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen) v. Nengwu He, Case No. 1:24-cv-11459, another NDIL district judge considered a similar fact pattern. Again, a PRC-based seller brought a declaratory judgment action against an out-of-state patent-owner who had caused the seller's products to be delisted from Amazon.com and who had failed to appear in court. An additional wrinkle in the facts was that Amazon had reinstated the seller's listings before the seller filed suit. In its February 7, 2025 ruling against the seller, the court used the same rationale as the Zhifu court to find that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the patentee-defendant (who had no contacts with the forum and whose actions had ""not in any way ... uniquely targeted Illinois""). In addition, the court further determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction as well. With the listings back online, the seller had no actual, immediate injury for the federal judiciary to redress, and therefore no actual case or controversy as required by Article III of the Constitution.
These and other recent NDIL rulings illustrate how the federal court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over litigants looking to adjudicate their rights with respect to potentially infringing (or non-infringing) sales on e-commerce platforms is not a two-way street. Rather, it one-sidedly favors the patentee-plaintiff who chooses NDIL as the forum to find and stop infringing sales; and conversely turns away the declaratory judgement plaintiff seeking to prove and resume non-infringing sales in the district.
Despite the seeming double standard, these rulings are not inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's SnapRays v. Lighting Defense Group decision from last year. In SnapRays, the appellate court held that a patentee's mere use of the APEX (Amazon Patent Evaluation Express) process or other informal platform-based dispute mechanisms can create an Article III case or controversy that opens the patentee up to a declaratory judgment action by the at-risk seller in the seller's home state, where the intended delisting ""would necessarily affect marketing, sales, and other activities within [that state].""
Here, the NDIL courts required a similar showing of enforcement activity targeted at its venue, concluding that a patentee's actions in initiating an Amazon takedown, without more, do not constitute purposeful direction of enforcement activities at Illinois. Rather, in Zhifu, the court recommended the seller bring suit in the patentee's home state of Ohio where patentee ""conducted all of its patent enforcement activity,"" and in Aixining, the court ordered the plaintiff to clarify the ""contacts that Defendant made with Illinois."" In sum, while an aggrieved merchant may sue the out-of-state patentee, NDIL is unlikely to be the proper forum in most cases unless the patentee singled out Illinois in its enforcement efforts.
Takeaways
On the one hand, patentees who complain about a merchant's questionable listing to the e-commerce platform or submit an I.P. dispute to its informal resolution process should expect this communication to give rise to a real case or controversy—i.e., the merchant could immediately seek a federal district court's adjudication as to non-infringement and/or invalidity of the U.S. patent. Even so, the patentee can reasonably expect to defend that suit where it is domiciled, unless its enforcement activity was also aimed at another forum (such as the home state of a targeted domestic merchant).
On the other hand, domestic and foreign e-commerce sellers should know that the NDIL's willingness to exercise jurisdiction over the same set of litigants when the patentee brings suit does not guarantee access to the same forum when the seller chooses to be the plaintiff. Depending on the facts, the district court in the seller's home state (if it is a domestic entity)—or, as a fallback, the patentee's home state—may be where the seller must initiate its declaratory judgment action.

The print-on-demand industry saw major shifts in 2024, with landmark mergers, tech innovations, and social commerce growth. Key partnerships like Canva & HP and Shutterfly & Amazon Prime reshaped the market, while TikTok Shop hit $32.6B in transactions. As 2025 begins, AI-powered fulfillment, automation, and e-commerce expansion will drive the next wave of industry transformation.
The print-on-demand industry underwent significant transformation in 2024, setting the stage for compelling developments in 2025. Let's examine the key events that shaped the industry last year and explore the trends that will define its future.
2024: A Year of Strategic Transformation
The past year brought substantial changes to the print-on-demand landscape, fundamentally altering how businesses operate and compete in this space.
Industry Consolidation Reshapes the Market
The industry witnessed historic consolidation in 2024, marked by the landmark mergers between Printful and Printify and S&S and alphabroder. These tie-ups signaled a clear shift in market dynamics and continue to reflect an evolving industry where scale and operational efficiency have become increasingly crucial. It wasn't long ago that the print on-demand production and distribution markets were highly fragmented. The consolidation we saw in 2024 was a clear indicator that the standard for scale has changed: a multi-facility, global presence is now a prerequisite for meaningful market presence.
Strategic Partnerships Drive Innovation
2024 was a year of partnerships. Collaborations continue to be a primary growth catalyst, with several notable announcements redefining market possibilities. Canva's strategic alliance with HP indicates a focus on global print quality consistency, while Shutterfly's partnership with Amazon Prime highlighted the continued importance of logistical excellence and fast shipping. Adobe's integration with Zazzle brought streamlined print functionality to Adobe Express, and Fanatics secured valuable partnerships with World Rugby and Juventus, strengthening its position in sports merchandise.
A Year of Technology, Innovation, and Social Commerce
The market welcomed innovative new software platforms in 2024, with Gelato introducing GelatoConnect and Gooten launching OrderMesh. Society6's comprehensive redesign on Shopify demonstrated the industry's commitment to enhanced user experience and YouTube too focused on streamlined experiences by introducing Creator Collections to make it easier for creators to promote and sell merchandise. Social commerce continued its impressive growth, with Tik Tok Shop reaching $32.6bn in transaction volume last year. Etsy had a leadership shake-up and Shopify posted record Q4 results, while Merch By Amazon relaxed admission requirements for creators making the Amazon marketplace even more competitive.

NEW YORK (AP) — In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, Amazon MGM announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.
Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights — but Amazon MGM will have creative control.
Financial terms weren’t disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.
“With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,” Wilson said in a statement. “Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.”
Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007 concluded with 2021's “No Time to Die,” Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.
The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in the more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.
“We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theatres around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,” said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. “We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.”
Bond had been a family business since Albert “Cubby” Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming’s novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962’s “Dr. No.” Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in box office.
In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.
“My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,” Broccoli said in a statement. “I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of ‘No Time to Die’ and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.”
A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will surely lead to doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned “Star Wars” and Marvel brands, have in recent years struggled with over-saturation.
In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.
“People are playing it very safe,” Broccoli said. “I think in times of crisis like this, you’ve got to be brave.”

After launching the powerful eero Max 7 and the tough eero Outdoor 7, eero expands Wi-Fi 7 portfolio with all-new eero 7 and eero Pro 7

eero 7 is the company’s most affordable Wi-Fi 7 router, offering multi-gigabit speeds in a compact form factor

eero Pro 7 delivers premium Wi-Fi 7 performance for high-bandwidth connectivity needs, offering fast wireless and wired speeds with two 5 GbE ports, and capacity for hundreds of devices
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced that eero is expanding its Wi-Fi 7 portfolio to include eero 7, delivering multi-gigabit speeds at a more affordable price, and eero Pro 7, offering premium performance for bandwidth-demanding networks. Thanks to the company’s TrueMesh, TrueRoam, and TrueChannel networking technologies, and the latest Wi-Fi 7 capabilities, eero 7 and Pro 7 will improve overall wifi performance, reliability, and latency; and help keep customers connected even as network conditions become more complex and demanding.
“For ten years, eero has obsessed over delivering exceptional wifi because we know it is as important as our electricity and running water. Back in my apartment in San Francisco, our ambition was to deliver an experience that's easy to use, is so reliable you don't have to think about it, comes with world-class security, and is thoughtfully designed to blend into any environment,” said Nick Weaver, CEO and co-founder of eero. “We've continued to innovate and have gone well beyond our first home mesh wifi system—there are tens of millions of eero devices that power homes and businesses across 24 countries. Today, I’m excited for the eero 7 and Pro 7 to join the Max 7 and Outdoor 7 and expand our Wi-Fi 7 portfolio to meet every internet need.”
eero 7—Wi-Fi 7 performance at a more affordable price
eero 7 is a multi-gigabit router for customers who rely on their wifi for every-day internet activities, like streaming, studying, and working, and are looking to upgrade to the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard at a lower price. eero 7 is a dual-band system with support for 2.4 and 5 GHz, and can deliver wireless speeds up to 1.8 Gbps and wired speeds up to 2.3 Gbps through its two 2.5 GbE ports. eero 7 delivers Wi-Fi 7 performance in a compact form factor that can easily fit on bookshelves, entertainment centers, and desks.
A single unit covers up to 2,000 square feet, providing a simple way to start a network in an apartment or small home; a two-pack covers up to 4,000 square feet; and a three-pack covers up to 6,000 square feet. Customers can connect as many eero devices as they need to get coverage throughout their homes.
eero Pro 7—Next-generation speed and reliability
eero Pro 7 is for more demanding customers who have high-bandwidth needs, want enough capacity to connect hundreds of devices, or live in a household with multiple people streaming content, playing online games, and working from home. It’s a tri-band system with support for 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz, providing more wireless spectrum to increase overall network capacity and avoid congestion, which helps improve performance when there are busy neighboring networks. eero Pro 7 can deliver wireless speeds up to 3.9 Gbps and wired speeds up to 4.7 Gbps through its two 5 GbE ports, making it ideal for customers with multigigabit plans and demanding internet needs.
eero Pro 7 also features the same fan-less, advanced passive thermal design as eero Max 7 that is silent and limits dust build-up. A single unit covers up to 2,000 square feet and 200 devices; a two-pack covers up to 4,000 square feet and over 400 devices; and a three-pack covers up to 6,000 square feet and over 600 devices.
