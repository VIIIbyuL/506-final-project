AAPL

On 1 January 2025, the UK's new regime for regulating digital markets, set out in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act 2024 (DMCCA), came into force. Since then, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has wasted no time in using its new powers, with investigations into Google's search and search advertising activities, Google and Apple's mobile ecosystems, and provisional findings in the CMA's cloud market investigation. At the same time, however, significant publicity has been generated by the Government's decision to replace the CMA's former Chair, Marcus Bokkerink, with Doug Gurr, formerly of Amazon's UK and China business units; and it remains to be seen whether this change in leadership will lead to a change in approach. In this blog post, we summarise the CMA's busy January and even busier year ahead and what this might mean for businesses across various sectors with touchpoints into digital markets.
The new digital markets regime: designate-then-regulate
In our DMCCA briefing series, linked here, we summarised the key features of the UK's new digital markets regime. In short, the DMCCA sets up a 'designate-then-regulate' system in which the CMA will, following an investigation:
The first two SMS investigations
With the digital markets regime going live on 1 January 2025, the CMA showed little signs of a New Years Day hangover. On 7 January, the CMA set its roadmap for 2025, with two investigations to be launched in January and a third later in the year (likely in May/June)1. True to its word, the CMA launched its first investigation - into Google's general search and search activities - exactly one week later 2. The following week, the CMA fired the starting gun for its second investigation, this time into Google and Apple's mobile ecosystems, broadly capturing operating systems, app stores and mobile browsers 3. Both of these investigations build on the CMA's prior work in relation to these services (described further below).
A few key points are worth noting in relation to these two investigations.
Instead, it is the potential remedies - which the CMA has signalled it will investigate ""in parallel"" to considering designation - that are more likely to be the focus of attention and efforts. And when considering what remedies are 'on the table' in the coming months...
The CMA's 9 month review timelines do not tell the full story. Experience in the EU with regards to its digital markets regime suggests that there may be judicial challenges to the CMA's decision-making which could further delay actual implementation of any designations and remedies.
CMA's verdict on cloud market
Less than a week after its second SMS investigation, the CMA published its provisional decision in its market investigation into the supply of public cloud infrastructure services in the UK - which has ultimately trailed another SMS investigation in the pipeline 7.
The CMA's investigation in relation to cloud services again builds upon a significant body of prior work. The CMA's market investigation directly follows on from an initial market study carried out by Ofcom, allowing it to borrow on the latter's sectoral expertise. The CMA has also previously looked at cloud gaming in the context of its Microsoft/ Activision merger review, and can also learn from the French Autorité de la Concurrence's in-depth review into cloud services. For a more detailed overview of the various competition law developments in relation to cloud services, please see our blog post here.
Even though the CMA's findings are only provisional at this stage, the report remains a highly-significant piece of work. The report numbers 513 pages accompanied by no less than 23 appendices and builds on the detailed market study already carried out by Ofcom. In its report, the CMA has identified various provisional concerns with the cloud market, including a lack of viable competitors to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft, various barriers to switching or multi-using cloud providers or entering/growing in the market, and evidence that customer switching (and efforts to entice customer switching) is even more challenging in the context of Microsoft software customers using Microsoft cloud solutions.
The CMA's key recommendation is that it should use its DMCCA powers to consider SMS designation and subsequent remedies to resolve the concerns identified. The CMA's statutory deadline for a final decision is 4 August 2025, which suggests that the third SMS investigation trailed for 2025 will cover a different topic unless the CMA's cloud market investigation process is curtailed.
The growth agenda
In and amongst these developments, the Government has provided a strong steer that the CMA must focus on growth when choosing whether and how to enforce. The CMA's work in relation to digital markets is likely to be especially closely scrutinised because the regime is nascent and therefore unconfined by previous precedent, with any remedies proposal likely to generate strong policy arguments from both sides of the debate on so-called ""big tech"".
On 23 January, shortly after Marcus Bokkerink's dismissal and on the same day as the launch of its second SMS investigation, the CMA published a paper arguing that its digital markets regime can be used to drive growth by harnessing the benefits of investment and innovation by big tech firms while also ""expanding opportunities for investment and innovation by creating a level playing field for start-ups and scale-ups (many UK-based) to succeed"". The word ""growth"" appears multiple times in the CMA's press releases for both SMS investigations 8, and on 28 January the CMA also published terms of reference for a new CMA Growth and Investment Council which brings together key senior stakeholders from the business world to discuss how best to support innovation, investment and growth 9.
Final thoughts
2025 looks set to be a seminal year in the development of competition and consumer policy in relation to digital markets. The CMA has begun 2025 with extensive new powers but also a strong steer to be careful how it uses them. The ITCs published with respect to the CMA's two SMS investigations are, as with traditional market studies, likely to play a critical role in shaping the CMA's output and proposed remedies, and it is likely that both sides of this debate will seek to frame their arguments in terms of how best to support and stimulate growth in the UK economy. The CMA has chosen to prioritise two areas of the digital economy which were previously the subject of in-depth market studies for its first two SMS investigations. It has done so intentionally to build on prior work and also to ensure its early work is targeted at issues with maximum cross-sectoral impact; indeed, most businesses will have at least some reliance on online search engines, online advertising and online apps to get their products and services across to customers. Given this, the CMA's digital debut is set to be watched closely by a range of businesses, both in the UK and (given the cross-jurisdictional nature of digital businesses) overseas. It remains to be seen whether the CMA will move fast and break things with its new powers, or instead speak softly despite its rather large stick.

By Kimberley Kao
Apple has reached an investment agreement with Indonesia after protracted negotiations, which should clear the way for the sale of iPhone 16 handsets in Southeast Asia's largest economy.
Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita said in a media briefing on Wednesday in Jakarta that Apple's investment plan for the 2025-2028 period has been approved, according to a release posted on the ministry's website.
He added that the ministry will proceed to issue the license Apple needs to sell iPhone 16s in the country.
Apple agreed to increase its investments in Indonesia, including committing to establish a research and development center focused on software development, the ministry said.
Apple supplier Luxshare will invest $150 million at a facility in Batam that will manufacture accessories for AirTag tracking devices, the ministry said.
Additionally, Apple has committed to sourcing AirTag battery components from Indonesian manufacturers, and is also preparing a production line in Bandung to manufacture mesh fabric for AirPods Max, the ministry said.
Apple will also bring in $160 million in fresh cash investments.
Apple and Luxshare didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.
The sale of Apple's latest iPhone 16 handsets had been banned since October over what officials characterized as the company's nonfulfillment of local investment requirements. Apple executives had visited Indonesia in January to continue discussions to lift the ban.
The industry ministry had said a previous proposal by Apple to build a factory to produce AirTag products in Batam wasn't sufficient to fulfill requirements related to a policy aimed at supporting domestic industries and reducing dependence on imported products.
Under the policy, companies have to meet set requirements for using goods or services sourced from within Indonesia. This can be done via various means, including manufacturing products, building factories or developing innovations domestically.
The cellphone market in Southeast Asia's largest economy is a lucrative one, benefiting from a large, growing population with rising disposable incomes.
There are an estimated 354 million devices in active use in Indonesia, according to the ministry. That compares with a national population of about 270 million, according to World Bank estimates.

(Reuters) -     U.S. officials are examining whether the U.K. broke agreements between the two nations with a reported demand that Apple build a backdoor into its encrypted cloud storage systems.
Apple last week withdrew an encrypted storage feature or U.K. users after refusing to create a backdoor that would have allowed the government to access backups of photos and messages - including for users outside the U.K.
In a letter dated February 25 to two U.S. lawmakers, Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said that the U.S. is examining whether the demand broke a bilaterial agreement called the CLOUD Act that bars the U.K. from issuing demands for the data of U.S. citizens and vice versa.

LONDON (AP) — Apple is fixing a bug within the dictation feature on some iPhones that briefly suggests the word “Trump” when a word with an R consonant is spoken, including ""racist.""
The company is responding to the controversy after some iPhone owners posted videos on social media this week to detail how the glitch works.
When users activated the dictation feature and said the word “racist,” the word “Trump” appears in the text window before quickly being replaced by the correct word, according to various videos posted online.
“We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers Dictation and we are rolling out a fix today,” Apple said in a statement sent to The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The company said that the speech recognition models that power the voice-to-text feature might show words with some phonetic overlap.
It also said that other words that have an “r” consonant were also erroneously triggering the bug. The Associated Press could not duplicate the problem on Wednesday, a day after it emerged.
This week the company announced a plan to invest more than $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the United States over the next four years as well as build a new factory in Texas, amid Trump's threats to impose tariffs on imports. Separately, Apple shareholders rebuffed an attempt to pressure the company into joining Trump’s push to scrub corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce.

AAPL

In a recent decision highlighting the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's growing concern with multiple petition practice, the PTAB has denied Apple's inter partes review petition challenging Smith Interface Technologies' patent, emphasizing that less can be more when it comes to IPR strategy.
The Board's February 13, 2025 decision in IPR2024-01086 rejected Apple's petition - one of seven parallel petitions filed against the same patent - marking a clear stance against what some practitioners call “petition flooding.”
“[I]n most situations, one petition is sufficient to challenge a patent's claims,” the Board emphasized, quoting its Trial Practice Guide. While acknowledging that multiple petitions might sometimes be necessary, the Board stressed that “this should be rare.”
Key Takeaway: The numbers matter. In this case, Apple challenged 91 unique claims across seven petitions targeting U.S. Patent No. 10,656,754, which covers technology for navigating between user interfaces. While the Board agreed that multiple petitions were warranted given the scope, it found seven to be excessive.
Apple's Argument Falls Flat
Apple attempted to justify its approach by arguing that word count limitations necessitated multiple filings. According to Apple's ranking notice, common sections across petitions “require[d] approximately 8,350 words,” leaving only “about 5,650 words per petition” for specific invalidity arguments.
The Board wasn't convinced. “Petitioner has not persuasively shown that so many words were actually required for these sections,” the decision stated, noting that “although we agree that the common sections needed to be repeated in each petition…we are not persuaded that the common sections required approximately 8,350 words.”
Notably, the Board pointed out that one of the three independent claims “is only fifteen lines long, and its technology is relatively simple, yet Petitioner's analysis of this claim stretches for seventeen pages.”
Strategic Implications
“We are persuaded that this group of cases is somewhat extraordinary and, consequently, that more than two petitions are justified,” the Board acknowledged, but ultimately concluded that “institution of three of the seven petitions is appropriate.”
The decision serves as a reminder that while the PTAB will accommodate legitimate needs for multiple petitions, practitioners must justify their approach and demonstrate efficient use of the Board's resources.
Final Impact
The Board's decision to consider only the top three ranked petitions of the seven filed and deny the rest - including this lowest-ranked petition - signals a continuing trend of managing the PTAB's docket through discretionary denials. This approach balances petitioners' rights to challenge patents with the Board's need to efficiently manage its resources.
For patent practitioners, the message is clear: when considering multiple petitions, make every word count and be prepared to justify the need for each additional petition. As this decision shows, more isn't always better in IPR practice.
Administrative Patent Judge Juliet Mitchell Dirba authored the decision, joined by Judges Nathan A. Engels and Sharon Fenick. Apple Inc. v. Smith Interface Technologies, LLC, Case No. IPR2024-01086, Paper 10 (PTAB Feb. 13, 2025).

(Reuters) -     Apple shareholders rejected a proposal against its diversity, equity and inclusion policies at an investor meeting on Tuesday, a major victory for the tech giant amid growing backlash against such initiatives in the United States.
The vote was a test of investor views about the value of DEI programs, which many companies added or beefed up starting in 2020 amid the Black Lives Matter movement.
Growing conservative pushback has led several large U.S. companies, including Meta, Alphabet and Amazon.com, to drop their DEI goals before and after Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency.
Apple shareholders also voted against an investor proposal asking the company to prepare assessing the risks of its work with artificial intelligence, while all management proposals were approved, a preliminary tally of the vote count showed.

Apple shareholders rebuffed an attempt to pressure the technology trendsetter into joining President Donald Trump's push to scrub corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce.
The proposal drafted by the National Center for Public Policy Research — a self-described conservative think tank — urged Apple to follow a litany of high-profile companies that have retreated from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the Trump administration's crosshairs.
After a brief presentation about the anti-DEI proposal, Apple announced shareholders had rejected it without disclosing the vote tally. The preliminary results will be outlined in a regulatory later Tuesday.
The shareholder vote came a month after the same group presented a similar proposal during Costco's annual meeting, only to have it overwhelmingly rejected. A similar outcome is expected during Apple's annual meeting despite the vocal objections of critics.
Just as Costco does, Apple has steadfastly stood behind diversity and inclusion efforts that its management contends make good business sense.
But the National Center for Public Policy Research's proposal has attacked Apple's diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. The group estimated about 50,000 Apple employees could file cases against Apple without detailing how it arrived at that figure.
“It’s clear that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,” the National Center for Public Policy Research says in its proposal.
The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against Target alleging the retailer's recently scaled-back DEI program alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of shareholders.
In its rebuttal to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple said its program is an integral part of a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current market value of $3.7 trillion — greater than any other business in the world.
“We believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apple’s success as making the best products in the world,” the company said in its statement against the proposal. “We seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.”
In its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple disclosed that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees were men.
Other major technology companies for years have reported employing mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs — a tendency that spurred the industry to pursue what have been largely unsuccessful efforts to diversify.

China’s leading smartphone brands, after dominating the world’s budget segment, are rushing to go premium in search of growth.
In Southeast Asia, Apple and Samsung together make up more than 90% of the market for smartphones over $600, according to data from market intelligence firm Canalys. Yet “brands like Xiaomi, vivo, Oppo, and Transsion dominate the lower price segments,” Sheng Win Chow, a smartphone analyst at Canalys, says.
“Affordable and competitive pricing” is helping Chinese brands penetrate emerging markets—not just Southeast Asia, but also Africa and Latin America, notes Will Wong, senior research manager with IDC’s Asia-Pacific client devices group.
But he warns that after successfully amassing market share in more budget-friendly segments, “it’s now or never for Chinese brands to target the premium segment.”
“The global smartphone market has entered a mature stage that’s only expected to log low single digit growth in the long term,” Wong says. That means that Chinese brands will need to grow on the basis of selling better phones, rather than more phones.
And Southeast Asia presents a good opportunity for these budget brands to crack a premium market that’s long been Apple and Samsung’s playground. Both Wong and Chow point out that the region’s growing economy means a rising class of consumers keen to upgrade their devices.
Last week, Oppo, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer, launched its latest foldable smartphone at a launch event held at Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands casino.
The “Find N5,” priced at 2499 Singapore dollars ($1870), is clearly a premium product. The phone is a rival in terms of features and quality to Samsung’s Z6 foldable phone, released in October. For instance, Oppo boasted during its launch event that its Find N5 was thinner when folded and also offers better battery capacity.
Oppo is already Singapore’s third-most popular smartphone brand, says Billy Zhang, president of overseas marketing, sales and services. Singapore’s consumers, while small in number, have a high-level of disposable income and are open to trying new premium products, he adds.
Besides Singapore, Oppo is also one of the top brands in the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia, according to IDC. That makes Southeast Asia a “fortress” for Oppo, Wong says, and a good launchpad for the brand to break into the premium market.
“Oppo has been one of the key Chinese vendors that promptly brought the latest GenAI and foldable features to the market with competitive prices,” he adds.
Other leading Chinese smartphone makers are also expanding their presence outside their home market.
Last week, Huawei marked the international rollout of its trifold smartphone at an event in Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysia launch was the first consumer electronics event the company’s held outside of China since the U.S. slapped sanctions on it in 2019.
HONOR, formerly Huawei’s budget smartphone division, is also focusing on Southeast Asia, planning 10 “experience” stores selling mid-to-high-end products in Indonesia, according to the South China Morning Post. 
Apple, too, is trying to expand its consumer base. Last week, the company unveiled the iPhone 16e, the successor to the budget iPhone SE. Yet, at $599, Apple’s lower-end phone is still pricey, costing over $150 more than the iPhone SE. By comparison, Oppo’s Reno 13, one of the brand's latest higher-end smartphones, costs $597.

(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia and Apple Inc. have agreed on terms to lift the country’s ban on iPhone 16s, said people familiar with the matter, paving the way to end a five-month tug-of-war that forced the US tech giant to raise its promised investment in the country to $1 billion.

The Ministry for Industry, which is responsible for upholding the ban, is set to sign a memorandum of agreement with Apple as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the talks, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. A press briefing will also be held, the people said, adding the ministry intends to issue a permit allowing iPhone 16 sales as soon as possible.
The deal concludes a battle that started in October after Indonesia refused to issue a permit for the sale of Apple’s latest device, citing a failure to comply with domestic manufacturing requirements for smartphones and tablets. Apple then pledged to invest $1 billion in Indonesia, an offer President Prabowo Subianto directed his ministers to accept. However, the Ministry of Industry last month unexpectedly upheld the ban as it sought better terms.
On top of the $1 billion investment, Apple will commit to training locals in research and development on the company’s products so they can then develop similar software and design their own goods, the people said. The move is set to placate the government, which has been pushing Apple to set up R&D facilities in the country, they added.
The innovation investment will be done through programs other than the existing Apple academies, one of the people said.
Apple has no immediate plans to start making iPhones in the country, the people said.
While both sides have agreed to the terms of the ban being lifted, Indonesia has backtracked on decisions before and the deal could still fall through.
Apple and Indonesia’s Ministry of Industry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
While January’s last-minute scuppering of the deal came as a surprise, talks had continued to progress positively, the people said. Last week, industry minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita announced Apple had settled a $10 million debt to the government for not complying with local rules between 2020 to 2023.
Win for Prabowo
The deal is a win for Indonesia, with its hardball tactics paying off to get a major foreign company to invest more to develop its goods in the country and boost local manufacturing, instead of merely using the nation as a sales hub. The government had previously said that Apple had invested only about $95 million in Indonesia.
The agreement also comes at an opportune time for Prabowo. The optics of a US tech giant yielding to his administration could be used to boost his domestic standing, which has taken a hit following multiple policy U-turns that have generated confusion. On top of that, his plan for sweeping spending cuts that threatened jobs and scholarships triggered days of protests last week.
For Apple, the deal gives it access to Indonesia’s massive consumer market at a time when sales in China have slowed. Though Apple ranks outside the top five smartphone brands in Indonesia, the country’s population of 278 million people — more than half of whom are under the age of 44 and tech savvy — is too good an opportunity to miss.
Apple’s $1 billion offer includes setting up a plant on the island of Batam to produce AirTags, a device that allows users to track their luggage, pets or other belongings. The US company is bringing on board one of its significant suppliers, Luxshare Precision Industry Co. to operate the plant which will eventually account for 20% of global production of AirTags, Bloomberg News previously reported.
Part of the investment proposal will also go toward setting up a plant in Bandung, about three hours southeast of Jakarta, to make other types of accessories, as well as funding Apple academies which equip students with tech skills like coding.

AAPL


Apple shareholders on Tuesday are expected to reject an attempt to pressure the technology trendsetter into scrapping its corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce.
The proposal drafted by the National Center for Public Policy Research — a self-described conservative think tank — urges Apple to follow a litany of high-profile companies that have retreated from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump.
It comes a month after the same group presented a similar proposal during Costco's annual meeting, only to have it overwhelmingly rejected. A similar outcome is expected during Apple's annual meeting despite the strident objections of critics.
Just as Costco does, Apple has steadfastly stood behind diversity and inclusion efforts that its management contends good business sense.
But the National Center for Public Policy Research's proposal has attacked Apple's diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. The group estimated about 50,000 Apple employees could file cases against Apple without detailing how it arrived at that figure.
“It’s clear that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,” the National Center for Public Policy Research says in its proposal.
The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against Target alleging the retailer's recently scaled-back DEI program alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of shareholders.
In its rebuttal to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple said its program is an integral part of a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current market value of $3.7 trillion — greater than any other business in the world.
“We believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apple’s success as making the best products in the world,” the company said in its statement against the proposal. “We seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.”
In its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple disclosed nearly that three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees at that juncture were men.
Other major technology companies for years have reported employing mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs — a tendency that spurred the industry to pursue what have been largely unsuccessful efforts to diversify.

(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc.

Philip Schiller, a long-time executive who helped develop the App Store, told US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers Monday he was “concerned” she would find that the new fee didn’t fulfill her 2021 directive that the iPhone maker expand payment options for consumers.
Apple is still fighting with Epic Games Inc. (EPGA.PVT) four and a half years after the maker of the popular Fortnite video game accused the technology giant of violating antitrust law by charging exorbitant fees at the App Store. After a trial Rogers concluded in 2021 that Apple hadn’t run afoul of federal laws, but she found that its policies prevent consumers from getting cheaper prices and ordered changes.
Epic contends Apple still hasn’t complied with her order, more than a year after the company exhausted appeals all the way to the US Supreme Court.
Early last year, Apple lowered the commission on some in-app payments from 30% to 27%. But app developers must pay separate payment processing charges that push their costs past 30%.
Was there “significant compliance risk because of the proximity to the 30% commission?” Gary Bornstein, a lawyer for Epic, asked Schiller in federal court in Oakland, California. “Yes,” Schiller replied.
Schiller testified last year that Apple believed it was complying with the judge’s 2021 order. “We are trying to enable what the law requires,” Schiller said in May.
Schiller said there were multiple people involved in the process, including Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He also said that he was concerned the commissions would create a more “antagonistic” relationship between the company and app developers.
An Apple spokesperson said that expressions of concern about charging a commission don’t indicate a lack of compliance.
At a hearing last year, Rogers voiced skepticism about the changes Apple made. “All this does is maintain the non-competitive environment that exists,” she said to Schiller at the time.
The dispute comes against the backdrop of law enforcement and regulatory action in the US and Europe. The Justice Department is suing Apple over a number of policies the government says is designed to give it monopoly power over the wide array of companies that rely on the iPhone to reach consumers.
Apple is also the target of multiple antitrust actions in the European Union and could be the first company to face a fine over a lack of compliance with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act. The company was also hit with a €1.8 billion ($1.88 billion) fine last year for abuses under the bloc’s traditional competition rules — involving music streaming.

Apple (AAPL) and its CEO, Tim Cook, announced plans to invest $500 billion in US operations over the next four years, which President Trump could leverage in his dealings with other chief executives.
Christoff & Co. CEO Niki Christoff joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss how Apple's latest developments could factor into the Trump administration's strategy.
""Tim Cook and Apple are at the very front edge of this, of making commitments and giving good headlines, and the president wants to move fast on the things that he has promised. And that is America first, including having American companies make things here,"" Christoff says.
The alignment between business success and the administration's goals creates a dynamic where companies are more inclined to cooperate. However, Christoff notes that not all CEO's share the same ideological views. ""I'd say people have described Tim Cook as 10% political and 90% business person, and I think that's right,"" she says.
I wonder, Nikki, if Trump, you know, he's hanging out there in Mar-a-Lago with another CEO, and he could say now, you know, listen, Tim Cook, he just announced 500 billion he's going to spend and invest here, uh, in the US for the next four years. I wonder, do you think it could be used by Trump as kind of leverage when he's talking to other execs? 
Absolutely. This administration loves to line everybody up and make them agree to different things. We just saw Microsoft as an investor in OpenAI and part of the Stargate Alliance, um, agree to a similarly sized investment in the United States. There's only so many companies that can go that far. But, you know, Tim Cook and and Apple are at the very front edge of this of making commitments and giving good headlines, and the president wants to move fast on the things that he has promised, and that is America first, including having American companies make things here. So, I am certain that that is a point of leverage with other conversations. 
Nikki, um, this Trump term feels very different from the last Trump term in a number of different ways. And one of them is that companies, um, seem more willing to work with the president. Is that defensive? Is that offensive? What do you think is driving it? And what, um, you know, are we seeing a disconnect? I mean, you talk to these companies. Are we seeing any kind of disconnect between these public facing announcements and what they're saying behind closed doors? 
This is a great question, and I don't think that you can lump all of the CEOs and the companies and executives together. You have people who appear to be more ideologically aligned with where President Trump and this administration is. I'd cite Mark Zuckerberg of Meta. And then you have people who are pure businessmen, right? Like the Jeff Bezoses of the world who, um, really doesn't need very much from this administration. And so, you have a spectrum where I'm not sure their ideology matches with their business imperatives. But all of them have businesses to run. I think the difference to your point is that in the first administration, things were extremely chaotic. They moved, uh, much more herky jerky throughout these first, you know, hundred days. That is not the case. They are moving at pace. They have an overwhelming majority in both Congress and in, uh, in the election results. And so, there appears to be a mandate. The president is moving fast, and they are, you know, they are jumping as as required, and that is part of their jobs. How they feel ideologically? I'd say it's people have described Tim Cook as 10%, uh, political and 90% business person, and I think that's right. 
Do you think, Nikki, you know, Trump, uh, he may talk tough, but do you think he would ever actually do anything to really go after big American tech, to jeopardize American tech in any meaningful way? Because if he did that, Nikki, he of course knows he might, you know, jeopardize the stock market. And this president watches the market very carefully. He uses the stock market as kind of report card on the administration's success or failure. 
Well, one definite boon to the technology industry with this administration is you have already the vice president going overseas to Europe and saying, ""You guys have been a drag on our companies."" Um, the the prior administration was brutal when it came to competition with Big Tech. I think we still might see some of that, but at the end of the day, President Trump sees himself as a business person, and he loves business success. So, no, I don't think he's actually going to kneecap American tech companies, but he does want them to show up and show some difference and give him some good headlines, which again, Apple has done this week. 
Regarding potential government interference within tech, Christoff asserts, “President Trump sees himself as a business person and he loves business success. So, no, I don’t think he’s actually going to kneecap American tech companies.”

Epic began the showdown four and half years ago when it first filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging that Apple had built an illegal monopoly around its popular App Store that makes billions of dollars annually from a then-exclusive payment system that collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app commerce.
Although U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected the monopoly claims, she ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options.
After spending more than two years trying to overturn Rogers' order paving the way for alternative payment links to appear in iPhone app, Apple exhausted all its appeals 13 months ago and finally opened the door for other options.
But Apple's solution still demands a 12% to 27% commission from on in-app transactions executive through alternative systems and erected other hurdles that Epic contends were designed to discourage switching to different options.
Gonzalez Rogers is now considering whether to hold Apple in contempt of court and order the Cupertino, California, company to make more drastic changes.
Since the judge began that process last May, she has expressed frustration with Schiller and other Apple witnesses about their hazy recollection about how they came up with the rules for app store's alternative payment system. Gonzalez Rogers' exasperation prompted her to delay the proceeding while another judge oversaw the wrangling over Apple's production of internal documents to provide further evidence about its decision-making process
Those additional records helped Epic lawyer Gary Bornstein refresh Schiller's memory about his initial reluctance to impose fees on in-app transactions outside of Apple's own payment systems.
“I had a question of whether we would be allowed to charge a commission,” Schiller said when asked about the views he expressed during meetings held in April 2023. “It was a question about what was allowed under the injunction” issued by Gonzalez Rogers.
Besides being worried the “compliance risk” posed by the fees on alternative payment options, Schiller said he also worried about “collection risk” because Apple would need to depend on app developers to transfer the money that the company said it was owed. With its internal payment system, Apple can simply take its cut of the transaction before sending the rest of money to the app developers.
“What happens if a developer doesn't pay and what is the process for that?” Schiller recalled about his initial reservations about requiring fees on alternative payment options. He also said he was worried about Apple's collection demands creating an antagonistic relationship with app developers that have traditionally been the company's allies.
But Schiller ultimately signed off on the commissions in January 2024 as part of a pricing committee that included Apple CEO Tim Cook and the company's chief financial officer at that time, Luca Maestri. During his testimony, Schiller also confirmed that Cook pushed for a warning screen informing consumers the potential security threats posed by alternative payment options.
The latest round of hearings in the ongoing tussle are scheduled to continue Tuesday and Wednesday. The other witnesses scheduled to testify include one of Schiller's top subordinates, Carson Oliver, who also testified last year.

Apple Fellow Phil Schiller, the executive in charge of leading the App Store, testified in court on Monday that he had originally raised concerns about the 27% commission the iPhone maker planned to charge app developers on any purchases made outside the App Store. In addition to being a potential compliance risk, he suggested that the fee would create an “antagonistic relationship” between Apple and developers and seemed to require Apple to have audit rights to check whether or not they owed Apple money for the transactions that took place outside the App Store.
Apple typically charges a 30% commission on in-app purchases, but the reduced fee of 27% was a result of the Epic Games-Apple ruling. In 2021, the court determined that although the tech giant was not a monopolist, it would have to stop blocking app developers from linking to other ways for customers to pay beyond Apple’s own in-app purchases (IAP).
Apple technically complied with the ruling by changing its App Store Guidelines to permit developers to link to their websites from their iOS and iPadOS apps to give customers an alternative way to pay.
However, Apple only reduced its commission by 3% for these purchases. 
At the time, Fortnite maker Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney called out Apple for “bad-faith” compliance, saying the tech company undermined the 2021 order from U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, which had granted developers the right to add buttons or links to other purchasing mechanisms in addition to Apple’s IAP.
Apple and Epic Games have since returned to federal court so Rogers could determine whether Apple violated her original order that forced the App Store to open to more competition.
According to Schiller’s testimony, he initially objected to commissions on these outside purchases. 
“… I had great concerns about the collections of funds from developers,” he said, specifically “the change in the role of the App Store to now an organization that needs to collect money from developers.”
He said he was worried about how the App Store would have to go after developers who didn’t pay the commissions, making it “some kind of a collection agency” that had “rules around how we handle nonpayment and whether ultimately it means we’re going to have to do audits of developers.”
Schiller said he worried about “how all of those things change the relationship between Apple and developers in a way I thought would be detrimental.”
The hearing has unearthed the extensive process Apple underwent while debating the merits of still charging a fee. With hosts of documents and emails, lawyers detailed the back-and-forth that took place internally at Apple as executives weighed different options regarding its compliance with the court’s order.
Despite the initial concerns Schiller raised, a pricing committee that included Apple CEO Tim Cook, former CFO Luca Maestri, and Apple’s legal team, alongside Schiller, ultimately decided to charge developers a commission on these outside purchases.
The company also decided the same 3% fee reduction would apply to developers in its Small Business Program, lowering their already reduced commission of 15% to 12% for transactions outside the App Store. 
Documents referenced in court indicated that Apple analyzed the financial impact on developers who chose to link out to their own websites. 
In one model, for example, Apple worked to determine how the “less seamless experience” of using a non-IAP method would lead customers to abandon their transactions. By modeling where this tipping point was, Apple was able to determine when the links would stop being an advantage to developers, which would push them back to using IAP.
Apple also found that more restrictive rules around the placement and formatting of the links themselves could reduce the number of apps that decided to implement these outside links. The company looked into the financial impact of excluding some other partners — like those in its video and news programs — from the new program.
The company weighed different options for when to charge commissions, too. At one time, it thought to charge its 27% fee on external purchases that took place within 72 hours of when the link was clicked. When the new guidelines went live, however, that time frame had been stretched to seven days.
Lawyers suggested Cook himself was involved with how the warning to App Store customers would appear, recommending an update to the text that appears when the external links were clicked. In one version, that link warned customers they were “no longer transacting with Apple.” Later, the link was updated to subtly suggest there could be privacy or security risks with purchases made on the web.
In another meeting about the commissions, people had also expressed concerns about Apple charging for web transactions. 
“This might be perceived like we’re trying to charge for what happens on the internet,” one of the notes from the meeting said.

U.S. stocks were mixed on Monday. Investors are turning their attention to Nvidia’s upcoming earnings — the first time the AI chipmaker is reporting results since a breakthrough by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sparked a selloff in Nvidia and other tech stocks last month.
By the end of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 0.08%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 lost 1.2% and 0.5%, respectively.
Here are stocks to watch today:
Apple (AAPL) stock edged up after the iPhone maker said Monday that it will invest $500 billion in the United States over the next four years, with a focus on supporting domestic manufacturing and AI.
It plans to open a 250,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in 2026 that will produce servers, hire thousands of workers across a variety of fields, and launch a new education initiative. Apple also said it was committed to expanding its data centers across the U.S.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) offloaded more equities last quarter, expanding its record cash reserves to $334 billion. Warren Buffett defended the size of the cash hoard in his annual letter , saying the majority of his investors’ money would always be invested in shares, mainly of American companies. The stock gained on Monday.
Microsoft (MSFT) shares fell slightly on Monday following an analyst report that the company canceled some U.S. data center leases, potentially signaling an oversupply of AI infrastructure.
On Friday, analysts at TD Cowen (TD-0.18%) said in a note that the tech giant had canceled leases worth “a couple of hundred megawatts,” or approximately two data centers worth of capacity.
Shares of athleticwear brand Nike (NKE) gained 5% to above $80 after Jefferies (JEF) upgraded its recommendation to “buy” from “hold” and increased its price target to $115 from $75, making the stock a “top pick” on anticipated improvements in profit margin and earnings per share.
Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as the AI chip powerhouse is set to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record for a U.S. company.
Palantir (PLTR) extended its decline on Monday following last week’s plunge that was driven by a new share sales initiative by the CEO and a media report of potential U.S. defense budget cuts. The stock is now about 30% down from its 2025 peak earlier this month.
Robinhood (HOOD) stocked gained on news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is dropping its investigation into the company’s crypto arm. The move comes just a few days after the financial watchdog dismissed the case against Coinbase.

Ricky Mulvey: Buffet's throwing a barbecue. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey joined today by Jason Moser. Jason, how is your long weekend, man?
Jason Moser: Ricky, you had me at barbecue, man. The weekend was great. It was Valentine's Day Friday, which is really nice. Happy Valentine's Day, everybody. Ricky, I hope you had a great one, too. Dan. You as well? It's nice. We're trekking through the winter here in Northern Virginia.
Ricky Mulvey: We're getting those nine degree days out here in Colorado. Having a podcast to keep me busy ain't so bad. Let's get into this Apple stuff because tomorrow, Apple is set to announce a new device. They haven't said what it is yet, but a lot of observers, including Bloomberg's Mark German, believe it to be a lower cost iPhone. The iPhone SE, which according to German's reporting, ""We'll have the company's first in house cellular modem chip, the A18 processor and Apple Intelligence, the home button will be replaced by Face ID in a USBC connector supplants the lightning port. Jason, anytime Apple is launching an iPhone, they need it to go well. What does Apple need from this launch tomorrow?
Jason Moser: I love all of the tech that you mentioned right there at the front. Because the meme that's out there I don't know if you've seen it and I'm sure most people have. It's the coffee mug, right, where the actual mug costs $500. But then the handle for the coffee mug costs an additional, I don't know, $1,000 or something like that. People are having a lot of fun with this one. We don't really know, but to me, what they need, honestly, they need something more than just a cheaper phone. They've been there and done that. Now, if this is the announcement that it is just a cheaper phone, I think it's going to be received with a collective sigh. That's not to say, I'm bearish on Apple.
I think Apple is an amazing company. I think what they've done has just been incredible. The technology they continue to produce is amazing. But I mean, this cheaper phone would rhyme with a lot of these other device launches, things like different size phones, different sized iPads, price points for everyone. It's just probably not as innovative as folks in the investing community might be looking for. But I guess we're going to have to wait and see.
Ricky Mulvey: That's why Apple is trying to figure out what's next as they look further out. You already know about the headset battle that they have with Meta. But Germans reporting that now the quieter competition is in robotics. Here's the two strategies as these companies go mono e mono, head to head. Meta's near term goal is to build basically the underlying software for robotics hardware makers. They want to be like the Android of your humanoid robots. Apple's trying a different tact because Jason, they like to keep everything in house. One of the ways they're going to do this for an at home robotics thing is I'm going to use my arm here, a tabletop device that's basically a robotic limb attached to an iPad.
What are your thoughts on these strategies? With the Apple one, I don't see how this tabletop device is solving a problem that really anyone has unless you're running around while you're on Zoom.
Jason Moser: I think that makes sense. It's in line with what Meta has been trying to do, particular you look at their AI strategy, for example, what they've been doing with their Llama models and whatnot. They're trying to kind of be the underlying software for people to create, whereas Apple operates in a little bit more of a walled garden, so to speak. The bigger opportunity here, a lot of this just reminds me of what Elon Musk said on Tesla's recent call here. He was talking about he thinks there's a path for Tesla to become worth more than the next top five companies combined. Now, he qualified that with saying, there's a very difficult path. It's not a done deal, but he could see it. But the key to that path was through autonomous vehicles and autonomous humanoid robots.
It doesn't surprise me to see Meta and Apple wanting to pivot in that same direction. Now, in regard to that Apple device, that robot iPad thing, I think you're right. I look at that and I think, This is really neat technology. It's amazing. Most of this technology, to me, it's all magic. It's just phenomenal but doesn't seem like it really solves a problem. It's like much of what they do these days, is just amazing technology, but it doesn't really solve a problem. It gives us a different way to do things, but that's not always necessarily so convenient. I think that's where Apple and others have been spinning their wheels for a bit. Now, on the flip side, I do think there are potential massive industrial applications here. I think about all of the work I've done over the past five or six years in regard to immersive technology, for example, and I think with immersive technology, a lot of the focus was on how is this going to impact the consumer us as the mass consumer. We're not quite there yet. The headset battles are still going on.
We're still trying to figure out exactly how we're supposed to use these things on a day to day basis, and the answer is not clear at all. But there are a lot of industrial implications that are already playing out right now. I think it's fair for investors to say, Look, there is a consumer side to this, but there's also an industrial side to this. Reminds me of the fire-foam that Amazon put out a while back. It seemed a dud from the get go, but you know they're going to learn some lessons from it. Maybe with Apple and this robot iPad device, maybe it's not something that really keys in on the mass consumer, but maybe they take some lessons from this, and it gives them some industrial opportunities that can make a difference down the road.
Ricky Mulvey: I think that's going to be the most clear with Meta, at least right now is they're looking into immersive tech, and a lot of investors have wondered, why are you spending so much on reality labs and studying how human hands move? They're spending billions of dollars on reality labs for this immersive tech for humans. But if you're studying it that closely, and then you can apply it to robotics, for the software, maybe eventually even the hardware of building humanoid robots, this might be the thing where ten years from now, Jason, we're looking at a case study of how a mistake became a billion dollar opportunity or whatever for Meta.
Jason Moser: I think that's a great point. There's no accident that all of these great companies are studying all of these phenomenal technologies. It's no accident that they're studying this stuff. You have to take that into consideration as well. There's something that will come from all of this. Granted, it might take a little time, but my suspicion is there will be some world changing stuff that eventually comes.
Ricky Mulvey: What's it going to take for you to get a humanoid robot in the Moser household? What's your bar for that?
Jason Moser: I don't even have a bar. I've thought about this before I love technology. Remember, I was one of the first to get an Alexa. I was just excited to see that technology, going back to that, what problem does it really solve? I just don't have any interest in some creepy robot skulking around my house at all hours, Ricky. I have a hard enough time trusting our cat isn't going to get off me in the middle of the night while I'm sleeping. Now, with that said, that's just me. I don't consider myself a proxy for what most people want. In fact, often I think I'm probably the opposite. But these are big ticket items, and I think that's something to keep in mind, as well.
Ricky Mulvey: You love cooking. Let's say there's something you don't love in the kitchen. Maybe it's peeling garlic. It gets stuck everywhere, as you're trying to chop it and mince it. You can outsource that now or soon to your humanoid robots showing up to your house.
Jason Moser: It's compelling.
Ricky Mulvey: Let's get into audience. We're coming off this wave of a big earnings week. Do you look at the war on cash? You think about payments companies and I wanted to look at a company that I own for selfish reasons, and that's Adyen, which is a behind the scenes payment processor for big companies. Think into it in Adobe. They're using audience technology to do their payment solutions. They report every half year is a European company. What they found is that revenue and processed volume grew by more than 20%. Adyen's investors sure were happy with these results. A lot happier than PayPal's investors were with PayPal's results. But as you dug into the earnings this morning, Jamo, what did you find?
Jason Moser: It seems to be on the right track in what is clearly a very competitive space. I like what Adyen does in focusing on trying to bring this singular solution to the payments industry. I like the fact that they focus on these big ticket customers because there's a lot of money that can be made there. Of course, you sacrifice a little bit there on pricing, but we'll have to see how that plays out. There's been a big question in regard to this company over the recent past years, just in regard to margins and intake rates. But I think the numbers, as you said, for the second half of 2024, very encouraging. Net revenue up 22% from a year ago, process volume up 22%. They noted that was actually 28% excluding a single large volume customer, but we're going to go with 22% Riky. Thought it was really great to see EBITA close to 570 million euros up 35% from a year ago. I thought this was, to me, what stood out, because this has been a big question over the last several quarters just in regard to that EBITA margin, EBITA margin came in there at 53%. That was compared to 48% from a year ago. Now, that was due to basically two things. We saw some strong top line growth with a scalable business, coupled with less hiring than they've seen in previous periods. They're becoming a little bit more efficient and they're making a little bit more with the money that they're making, which I think is encouraging.
Ricky Mulvey: There's one metric I want to get into because not all companies report this. I thought it was interesting to brag about this, Jason, but the shareholder letter is promoting that Adyen has a net promoter score of 66. Essentially, net promoter score is, how likely are you to recommend this business to a friend? If you think of companies like Amazon Prime, high net promoter score, or even Chewy, when they've reported that has been a pretty high net promoter score. Jason, 66, is that low? 66 seems low.
Jason Moser: [laughs] I know. Everybody asks, Is that good? Is that bad? It requires you to dig in there and understand a little bit about what the net promoter score actually is. To clarify, this net promoter score, the NPS, you're calculating this based on the answer to one key question, and it's using a 0-10 scale. How likely is it that you would recommend this particular brand to a friend or a colleague, and you can score it in one of three groups. Promoters are considered scoring 9-10, passives score 7-8, detractors score 0-6. Then ultimately the calculation is subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters, that ultimately yields the net promoter score. Now, that can range from a low and absolute low -100 to a perfect score of 100, which is really unheard of.
But I thought it was interesting to look this up the creators of the net promoter score, it's Bain & Company, and they suggest this framework where they say, a score above zero is good, a score above 20 is favorable, a score above 50 is excellent, and then a score above 80 is world class. We can see where Adyen is concerned. It seems like based on the numbers, they're not doing too bad.
Ricky Mulvey: We're going to negative 100. You think it'd be 0-100, but you start working in those negative numbers, it can get a little tricky, 66, it's actually good. Let's move on to our final story, which is another one from last week that we're picking up in this post President's Day, A segment. That's Berkshire. They released their buys and sells in the latest 13F statement. A closely watched SEC filing to see what Warren Buffett and his lieutenants Ted Wexler and Todd Combs are up to. Jason, this is what they're up to over the past quarter. They seem to be trimming, not seem to be. They are trimming their big banks holdings, Bank of America, Capital One, Citigroup. Meanwhile, looks like Buffett's throwing an outdoor barbecue. He's getting Domino's pizza. He's getting some beer with Constellation Brands, and what's a barbecue without a pool? He's grabbing some Pool Corp which does a lot of maintenance and services for pools. Let's start with the banks, though. What's going on with these banks numbers? Seems like Buffet's getting a little pessimistic on that.
Jason Moser: That could be the case. He's done very well with these holdings for the most part. I think that's something to keep in mind. This could be a testament that maybe they feel like the economy in the near term might be a little bit more challenged. The interest rate environment may be a little bit higher than perhaps they were thinking previously before. It's worth noting too. He's held Bank of America for some time, and has done very well with it. Trying to take some of those gains and be a little bit more productive with them makes a lot of sense. I wouldn't read too much into it, but, I mean, it is something to think about, for sure.
Ricky Mulvey: I want to look into these tea leaves. He wants to throw a party. He's doing pizza, beer, and pools. What's going on here?
Jason Moser: I love that. Pizza and beer, it's a great combo. I absolutely see the love for adding to Domino's. I mean, it's really a tremendous operator in its space. We know, obviously pizza. What Domino's does so well, they execute so well, not only on the delivery side but on the pickup side as well. Being an international business, I think, generally speaking, when you have that brand identity and you have the control over that company that they do, you can maintain some quality in regard to the end product, and that matters a lot.
In regard to Constellation, I think that really, to me, that strikes me as a big value play. Given how the company has performed over the last year or so when you look at the results, it's been very encouraging. They've been able to capitalize on Bud Lights misfortunes. Modelo Especial, has been performing very well. They noted they grew to pollutions there with that franchise over 3% last quarter, and it's upheld its position as the top share gainer in the US. Both companies pay very nice dividends, which I think is encouraging. Another interesting one it seems like a very Buffet-style investment. Hey, everybody loves Fools. It's big business. They're the leader in the space. The stock has had a very tough year, while it's worth noting, this is not one that lights the world on fire. A lot of the challenges we've seen have been in discretionary spend here recently, we'll just have to see how that plays out, but interesting picks.
Ricky Mulvey: For the stock investors looking at that, maybe looking to follow in Buffett's lead a little bit, are there any overall retail lessons for investors like you and me who are looking at what Berkshire is doing?
Jason Moser: For me, the perpetual lesson here is that it's always fascinating to see what smart and prudent investors are doing. But that doesn't mean you should necessarily be doing it too. There is a very big difference between what I'm personally trying to accomplish versus what they do. Of course, we're all trying to make money at the end of the day. But we're in very different boats, and we have very different goals. I think that's always just something to keep in mind is their actions, while interesting doesn't necessarily mean we need to mimic them because we need to take into consideration our ultimate goal as individual investors, as well.
Ricky Mulvey: Jason Moser, your actions always interesting to me. Thanks for being here. Appreciate your time and insight.
Jason Moser: Thank you.

Ricky Mulvey: Up next, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp take on your questions about saving for kids and starting a 401k at your workplace.
Alison Southwick: Our first question comes from Vinny. Hi, Alison, and Bro. Thank you for your always excellent advice and perspective on preparing for retirement. Thanks, Vinny. Bro is going to take a victory lap. He's back. Vinny writes. My wife and I welcomed our first child and future Fool into our family over the weekend. Congrats, Vinny. That's awesome. We want to start investing on his behalf as soon as we can. We want to use the money for education and to set him up for the long term. You've covered at length the 529 and brokerage accounts options, but we have issues with all of them. We want to control our investments. We don't trust that the 529 funds converting to Roth IRA will stick. We don't want to give over control of a custodial account at 18 and would prefer if we could make the account tax-advantaged somehow. All that to say, we don't love our options. Can you please compare and contrast the plans and maybe jump into any plans, accounts that I'm missing here? Thanks.
Robert Brokamp: Well, Vinny first of all, congrats on the newborn child and the new adventure. It's going to be a lot of fun. Secondly, you say you want to use the money for education and to set your son up for the long term. Those are somewhat different goals, depending on how you define setting the kid up for the long term, but maybe we'll talk a little bit about that. Thirdly, frankly, none of these options are going to satisfy all your criteria. Let's just do a really quick lightning round of your options and the pros and cons, and you can decide which has the pros that most outweigh the cons for your situation. For saving for college, by far, the most popular option is the 529 plan. The pros, money grows tax-free, if used for qualified education accounts, very high contribution limits. It varies by state, but we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly deduction on the state income tax return. If it's opened and owned by the parent or grandparent, it's considered their asset, not the kids, and that's beneficial when it comes to applying for financial aid and any unused money can be transferred to any other eligible relatives or to a Roth IRA if certain conditions are met.
Now, you say you don't think that's going to last. I've not heard that it's going to be eliminated, but sure, it could possibly happen, and you definitely do have to meet the criteria. The account has to be open for 15 years. You can't move over money. It's been contributed over the last five years. There are definitely a lot of rules around that. Now, there are really only two main cons to the 529, and that is you can only invest in mutual funds. If you love stocks, you can't do that. The investments can only be changed twice a year. If you're a long-term investor, it's no big deal, but you don't have a lot of flexibility. But if you don't like that or if you're looking for other options, another option is the Coverdale Education Savings Account. The pro of the Coverdale is that you can invest in stocks, and like the 529, the withdrawals are tax-free if you use for qualified education expenses.
The downside is very low annual contribution limit, just $2,000. Although there's still time to make a contribution for 2024, you have until April 15th. You can't contribute if you earn above a certain amount of money that starts to phase out at $95,000 for singles, 190,000 if you're married, though you can get around that by gifting the money to somebody else, and then they make the contribution. With the Coverdale, the money must be used by age 30. It can be transferred to another relative, not to a Roth IRA. Let's talk about some other options that you touched on, as well. You could open a brokerage account owned by the kid. This is an UTMA or an UGMA. The main advantage is there's some tax advantages. There's a certain level of interest in capital gains and investment income that is tax-free to kids or taxed at a low rate. The downside, as you touched on, is the kid does get control at the age of majority. It depends on your state, but eventually they do get it, and you have to hope that they're responsible with it. It is considered an asset of the kid, which will have a more harmful effect on financial aid eligibility when they go to college.
Now, you could instead have a brokerage account that's owned by the parents. That way, you maintain control, and then you just gift the investments to your son when you think he's ready, and you can do it all at once or just gradually over time. It's your asset of the parent, so it does not have as much of an effect on financial eligibility. The downside is you will owe all the taxes on the investment income, capital gains, or whatever else is going on in that account for as long as you own it. Then the last thing I will highlight is the Roth IRA. This is the thing like, if you really want to set your son up for being financially secure in the long run, do a Roth IRA. It grows tax-free if left alone until age 59.5. You can take some money tax and penalty-free out beforehand for qualified higher education expenses. You can always take out the contributions tax and penalty-free for any reason, and then the withdrawals for higher education expenses will be free of the 10% early distribution penalty.
The downside is the kid has to have earned income. Unless your newborn is already working, they're probably not earning money. There are people who try to get creative with this, so maybe they have a business. They take a picture of their kid. They put it on their business website, and then they pay their kid a modeling fee. There's all funny ways that people try to get around it, but they do have to have earned income. Like the regular brokerage account, it is their money so they can control at the age of majority. All this to say, there's no perfect solution, but it's also not an either or decision. You could choose two or three or more of these options, and regardless of which you choose, your son is very lucky that you and your spouse are already thinking about his financial future. Just know that everything that I discussed here is just the basics. To learn more about all these options, especially when it comes to paying for college, visit savingforcollege.com.
Alison Southwick: Our next question comes from Brett. My question is about valuations, the price-to-earnings ratio or PE to be specific. I read an article some years back about investors being price-anchored to PE when they first started investing. If you look back 100 years or so, you'll see spikes above 20 were rare until the '90s. From then on, PE ratios continue to climb steadily. My question is, can PE ratios be affected by inflation? Like every other good whose price climbs, why wouldn't valuations be more expensive over time? Does that correlation stick?
Robert Brokamp: Well, Brett, I would say that the E in the PE, the earnings are definitely affected by inflation. Earnings are profits. Profits are what you charge for revenue minus the cost of doing whatever you do to make a business. If inflation is higher, the inputs into your business are higher, which could reduce earnings. On the other hand, if a company can increase the prices above the rate of inflation, then earnings will benefit. But inflation doesn't really explain why people are willing to pay more for earnings over the past few decades, which is the P and the PE ratio. But there are a few theories for why over the last 20 or 30 years, PEs have risen. One is that it's because interest rates have been really low, which can be good for stocks because loans are cheaper to the business, and there's not as much competition from cash and bonds. Interest rates have gone up over the past year or so, but they're still very low compared to what they were in the '80s and '70s.
Another possible reason suggested by Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel, is that investing is now easier and cheaper. You can invest with the click of a button and you don't have to work with a stock broker. Siegel says that commissions and bid-ask spreads used to reduce the returns as someone earned by 1-2% a year, whereas now transaction costs are virtually nothing, plus tax rates are lower now, so stocks deserve a higher premium, according to Siegel. Finally, there's just more demand for stocks, largely thanks to the popularization of 401ks and IRAs over the past 40 years. According to the Federal Reserve, less than 10% of households own stocks in the early 1980s compared to more than 50% today. There are plenty of possible reasons why PEs have mostly been higher in 2000, but it's not likely due to inflation.
Alison Southwick: Cat writes. Does a stock's price go down proportionately to cover a dividend payment, or is it just a reaction from the investing community?
Robert Brokamp: Well, I think the answer is both. The price does go down proportionally, but it's due to a reasonable price adjustment that is basically demanded by the investment community. When a company pays a dividend, it's essentially distributing one of its assets, in this case, cash. After the company distributes an asset worth millions of dollars, and in some case, hundreds of millions of dollars, the price of the stock should adjust because the company is no longer worth as much. Here's generally when you'll see it happen. When a company declares a dividend they will also declare a record date, which is when you have to be a shareholder of record to get the dividend. In most cases, the record date will also be the ex-dividend date, though sometimes ex-dividend date is a day before. You have to own the stock before the ex-dividend date to get the dividend.
That ex-dividend date is generally when you'll see most of the adjustment to the stock price because anyone who buys it on that date or later won't get the dividend. If the dividend is small, it may be hard to tell whether any of the price movements are due to payout or just regular market noise. But if it's a higher-yielding stock you're looking at or a higher-yielding fund, such as a bond fund, you'll see a much more noticeable price adjustment on that ex-dividend date.
Alison Southwick: Our next question comes from Jonathan. Hi, Alison and Bro. I've been a long time listener back when you had your own show. I even sent you a postcard at one point. Jonathan, I still have that postcard somewhere.
Robert Brokamp: I'm sure it is somewhere.
Alison Southwick: We have hundreds and hundreds of them from listeners. Thank you. Jonathan Writes, my mum passed away in 2023, and we, my sister and I sold her house in Arlington, Virginia in 2024. We hired a CPA to handle the taxes for the trust and the estate, and they told us that as the beneficiaries, we should expect to receive a K-1 form from both the estate and trust. What exactly is the K-1 form, and how will that affect my personal income taxes?
Robert Brokamp: There are a couple of versions of the K-1. A couple of those versions are for businesses, so that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about the K-1 that is specifically for estates and trusts. You can pull the form up on the Internet, and you'll see basically especially with the trust, you'll have a share of any of the income that is distributed by the trust. K-1 will say, how much of it is yours and how it should be categorized. If you look at the K-1 form, you'll see different lines for interest income, ordinary dividends, qualified dividend, short-term gains, long-term gains and then you basically take that information and put it on your income tax return when you file your taxes.
Generally speaking, there aren't that many taxes related to the estate because one of the jobs of an executor is to pay the estate's taxes before the money is distributed. But since your CPA said you might get something, keep an eye out for it. I would just say since you have any CPA, you might want to get help from that CPA to know where to enter the information on your tax return and if you use any tax prep software, you probably could do an online search for how they handle information you receive from a K-1.
Alison Southwick: The next question comes from Mason. My workplace, a nonprofit, does not offer a 401k. How have you seen workers effectively advocate for one? Who should I tell the director to go to in order to start one?
Robert Brokamp: I would say, the first thing to do is talk to the director about why they don't offer one. You want to understand what the limitation is. It might be just that they're not particularly savvy about investments or retirement or anything like that or benefits. A lot of small companies, a lot of small nonprofits are very good people who started their companies or nonprofits for good reasons, but they're actually not that aware of how to do all this. Just find out why they don't, and then explain why you want one. Why it's good for the organization. It's a retention tool. It keeps employees, attracts employees, and it's good for the director, too, if the director works for a nonprofit, and then knowing that criteria, maybe help doing some of the research.
Nonprofits are generally associated with 403(bs), but a few changes over the past couple of years have made it easier for nonprofits to have a 401k, so you don't have to limit yourself to the 403(b). If it comes down to cost and administrative overhead, perhaps the easiest choice might be what's called a non-ERISA 403(b). ERISA is E-R-I-S-A. It's referencing a law that was passed in 1974 that basically regulates retirement plans. By making it a non-ERISA 403(b) that'll be easier and cheaper to operate, but it has some drawbacks, such as there are not as much protections for the workers, and the employer can't offer a match, but it might be better than offering nothing.

Apple,2025-02-24,Corporate America dusts off a familiar playbook for Trump,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=dbf0bfe535e227316e7ffcb0f720153ae2eef48a4fb2f9e955781eaaf4926224,"President Donald Trump has adopted Silicon Valley’s mantra of “move fast and break things,” leaving uncertain companies grappling with a potentially expanding trade war, slews of executive orders, and no end of legal questions.","Oops, something went wrong
President Donald Trump has adopted Silicon Valley’s mantra of “move fast and break things,” leaving uncertain companies grappling with a potentially expanding trade war, slews of executive orders, and no end of legal questions.
The second administration will “bring about a new era of American governance, with new rules, new norms, and risks” Frontline Government Relations CEO Michael Glassner, a top 2024 Trump campaign adviser, said as he launched his new lobbying firm in January.
That already appears to be true. But major American companies are already largely sticking to old tricks from Trump’s first term to curry his favor — and influence his administration’s policy.
Executives at companies including General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F) have traveled to Washington to meet with trade groups and Republicans in Congress, while Airbus (AIR) and others are lobbying to support programs they care about. Trump’s inaugural committee broke fundraising records as companies sought his attention.
More than half a dozen firms — from Facebook parent Meta (META) to Coinbase (COIN) — have hired Trump loyalists as consultants or for their boards, as some did during the president’s first term. And lobbyists with connections to Trump have gotten plenty of new clients, Bloomberg News reports.
But it was Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday who showed why companies continue drawing from a well-worn playbook for a successful relationship with Trump.
During Trump’s first term, Cook managed to balance developing a good relationship with the president, even as he criticized some of his positions. The CEO built his goodwill with the president through focused one-on-one phone calls and meetings, close relationships with Trump’s family, and a willingness to let things slide, according to the Wall Street Journal.
“Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly,” Trump told reporters in 2019. “That’s why he’s a great executive because he calls me, and others don’t.”
After Trump issued the so-called “Muslim ban,” Apple (AAPL) joined a lawsuit opposing the action and Cook penned a memo criticizing the policy. But Trump continued to meet with Cook and mention him throughout his presidency, often labeling him a “great executive” and touting Apple’s investment plans, even if he got the details wrong.
That paid off in a big way in 2019 when Cook convinced Trump to give Apple an exemption from tariffs that impacted parts used in Mac Pro computers. After the exemption, Cook gifted Trump one of the first Mac Pros built at its new U.S. facility.
About six years later, Apple is staring down even more tariffs. Trump earlier this month slapped Chinese imports with 10% tariffs. Beijing retaliated with its own duties, as well as some actions against U.S. companies, including a potential investigation into Apple.
On Monday, a few days after meeting with Trump, Apple said it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the length of his term, with a focus on manufacturing. In a statement, Cook said Apple is bullish on American innovation.
Trump rushed to take credit, claiming that Apple wouldn’t invest even as little as 10 cents if it didn’t have faith in his administration. That may help Cook again secure Apple an exemption from Trump’s tariffs.
“We see this primarily as an attempt at earning a tariff exemption,” Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said over email, adding that “we think [Apple] is on the path to” earning another exemption from Trump’s tariffs, as it did in 2019.
Representatives for Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.
Apple’s stated investment — which Deepwater Asset Management estimates amounts to a roughly $20 billion increase in annual spending — is rivaled only by the $500 billion Stargate project backed by Microsoft (MSFT) and SoftBank, among others. Stargate, announced almost immediately after Trump took office, aims to develop infrastructure for OpenAI’s artificial intelligence over the next four years.
Both companies announced plans for facilities in Texas, a conservative-leaning state that has become home to a growing number of tech firms. Stargate’s data center campus was already being built ahead of the project’s unveiling at the White House.
Apple’s plans are similar to those announced during the prior two administrations. In January 2018, Apple said its “direct contribution to the U.S. economy” would be more than $350 billion over a five-year period, later “accelerating” its investments with a $430 billion commitment in early 2021, when Joe Biden was president.
Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described Apple’s announcement Monday as a strategic move that lets the company diversity its manufacturing, while also playing into Trump’s theme of U.S. investment, pointing to Stargate. Both Trump and Biden focused heavily on U.S. manufacturing on the campaign trail and throughout their time in office.
And in both cases, Apple offered large numbers for local and federal officials to tout, even if some projects were later put on hold — such as Apple’s planned campus in North Carolina that never materialized. Such announcements also tend to include previous agreements that companies spend on, such as purchases from suppliers, rather than direct investments.
“[T]hese cumulative numbers can include a lot,” Kerwin said, “and shouldn’t be viewed as fully incremental to existing operations.”

Apple,2025-02-24,"Apple to hire 20,000 people, invest $500 billion in the U.S. amid Trump tariffs",Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=66e7652a4166f45377131f527dc37b4c59503f8a2203f285bc7e083d45a7a118,Apple is among tech giants unveiling plans about how they plan to invest billions in the United States as they face potential tariffs and tech policy changes during President Trump's second term.,"Oops, something went wrong
Apple said Monday that it plans to invest $500 billion in the United States, hire 20,000 people and open a new manufacturing factory in Texas over the next four years.
“We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said in a statement.
The iPhone maker's announcement underscores how tech giants are trying to forge a closer relationship with President Trump as his second administration imposes new tariffs on China — where Apple manufactures its products — and shapes policies on artificial intelligence.
Apple's pledge to expand manufacturing in the U.S. came after Cook met with Trump last week. In a speech to governors in the White House, Trump said Apple was planning to ""build here instead because they don't want to pay the tariffs.""
Trump this month imposed a 10% tariff on imports from China. Citing concerns about illegal immigration and drug trafficking, he also announced tariffs against Canada and Mexico but then said they would be paused for 30 days.
Apple said workers at the factory in Texas will produce servers for Apple Intelligence, an AI system that can help people write, proofread text and complete other tasks. The 250,000-square-foot facility is expected to open in 2026 in Houston.
The 20,000 new jobs will mostly focus on research and development, silicon engineering, AI and machine learning, the Cupertino, Calif., company said.
It's also doubling its spending on a fund that supports advanced manufacturing and skills development to $10 billion from $5 billion. The company previously announced the U.S. advanced manufacturing fund during Trump's first term in 2017.
Apple said in addition to the plant in Houston, it plans to expand in other states including California, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, North Carolina and Washington.
Those expansion plans include investments in data centers, its facilities and skills development for students and workers. At a manufacturing facility in Arizona, Apple said, it will spend heavily to produce advanced silicon that is used in its devices. In Detroit, the company said, it's opening a manufacturing academy that will offer free courses online and in person. Apple engineers will team up with university experts to help small and medium-sized businesses implement AI and manufacturing methods.
Other leading tech companies also have touted new investments in the wake of Trump's election. Meta announced it was planning to build the world's longest undersea cable to expand high-speed internet access globally. In Trump's first week in office, OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank announced a $500-billion investment over four years in computing infrastructure to power AI.

Apple,2025-02-24,"Trump takes a victory lap on Apple’s $500 billion U.S. investment, but one analyst calls it ‘completely unrealistic’",Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3c7bba614996b811f92d359e4545d4a92e5d69687aed56d5c04f90643caeb4d2,"Another analyst said, “Cook continues to prove that he is 10% politician and 90% CEO,” referring to the Apple chief executive.","Oops, something went wrong
President Donald Trump thanked Apple chief executive Tim Cook after the company announced a $500 billion U.S. investment plan that would create 20,000 jobs. It not only helps Apple gain his favor via his “America First” agenda but could help it avoid tariffs. One analyst called it a smart move, while another thinks it’s unrealistic.
It didn’t take long for President Donald Trump to take his victory lap after Apple announced a plan to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. over the next four years.
“APPLE HAS JUST ANNOUNCED A RECORD 500 BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,” Trump posted to his social media platform. “THE REASON, FAITH IN WHAT WE ARE DOING, WITHOUT WHICH, THEY WOULDN'T BE INVESTING TEN CENTS. THANK YOU TIM COOK AND APPLE!!!”
The largest-ever spending commitment by Apple would expand its teams and facilities throughout the country and build a new factory in Texas that would advance its artificial intelligence push. “We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in a press release.
But in a note to investors, UBS analyst David Vogt said “call us a skeptic…we believe it lacks substance,” referring to the announcement and large headline figure, citing multiple reasons. For one, only 10% of Apple’s supply chain is in the U.S. while the rest is throughout Asia, he told Fortune—and it has probably taken the company close to a decade to make that 10% happen.
His note also points to other parts of the investment plan that don’t quite add up. He estimated that the addition of 20,000 employees would translate to just $5 billion in extra operating expenses per year.
Plus, Apple only spends about $10 billion a year on data-center capital expenditures, per the UBS note, and it only generates about $100 billion a year in free cash flow, of which $90 billion goes to share buybacks, he said.
Given that Apple’s current $10 billion in capex is just a fraction of the $125 billion a year that the new U.S. investment would require, Vogt questions where the additional money will come from, adding that he doesn’t believe Apple will slash its buybacks.
So $500 billion over the next four years is “completely unrealistic mechanically,” Vogt told Fortune, adding that “it’s unclear where the cash flow comes [from] to try to even remotely attempt this.”
Vogt would not comment on why Cook is making this move. But Apple has announced similar investments before: a $350 billion contribution to the U.S. economy in 2018 during Trump’s first term, and an acceleration of that amounting to $430 billion, which was announced in 2021 during the Biden administration.
Since his return to office, Trump has stressed an “America First” policy and has imposed tariffs on imports from China as evidence of such. Apple’s announcement not only cooperates with the president’s agenda but attempts to steer clear of his tariffs.
It comes days after Cook met with the president, and Trump claimed of Apple: “They’re going to build here instead because they don’t want to pay the tariffs.” Not to mention, the technology billionaire had a prime spot for Trump’s inauguration and reportedly personally donated $1 million for the event.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pointed out that Apple’s U.S. investment plan diversifies its manufacturing strategy and plays well into “Trump’s U.S. investment theme.”
“Cook continues to prove that he is 10% politician and 90% CEO and times like this he will be using his strong ties globally to make sure [it's] smoother waters for [Apple HQ in] Cupertino ahead despite the market agita around AAPL’s growth initiatives with Trump heading down the tariff threat path,” he wrote in a note.
He did not express overt skepticism about Apple’s announcement but said he did not view it as “a signal that Apple is tweaking its China manufacturing buildout.”
Apple did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

Apple,2025-02-24,"Apple to Invest $500 Billion in U.S. Over Four Years, Expanding Manufacturing and R&D",Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b197bd472612e76cf66c3b98c691417702dd15c5e6ebd204c7743b1c01f5c443,"A new 250,000-square-foot factory in Texas will produce servers for Apple Intelligence, opening in 2026.","Oops, something went wrong
Apple (AAPL, Financials) plans to invest more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years, focusing on artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and manufacturing expansion, the company announced Monday.
The money will finance new manufacturing projects including a Texas facility and more R&D expenditure. Apple will also create a manufacturing school in Michigan to equip people in innovative manufacturing technologies and boost its U.S. Innovative Manufacturing Fund to $10 billion.
Apple will build a 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing plant in Houston as part of its development. Set to debut in 2026, the facility will generate servers for Apple Intelligence, a personal assistant powered by artificial intelligence. Previously produced outside the United States, the servers will run Apple's Private Cloud Compute mixing security architecture with artificial intelligence processing. Apple intends to additionally increase data center operations in Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina, Iowa, and Oregon.
Originally established in 2017, Apple's Advanced Manufacturing Fund will get an extra $5 billion in support. A substantial amount of this money will go toward supporting chip manufacture at Arizona's Fab 21 plant run by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM, Financials)
With more than 2,000 employees and starting mass-producing Apple chips last month, Apple is the biggest client at the facility. The company's suppliers run 24 chip manufacturing facilities spread across 12 states, therefore supporting its attempts at domestic manufacture.
With intentions to speed recruiting in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and silicon engineering, Apple's research and development investment in the United States has almost quadrupled over the previous five years. Over the next four years, the corporation wants to create 20,000 new positions in various sectors, therefore broadening its workforce among many states.
Apart from R&D development and production, Apple will set up a new manufacturing college in Detroit. Small- and medium-sized companies will be able to get smart manufacturing and artificial intelligence training at the facility. Designed with Michigan State University specialists, the program will comprise online and in-person courses emphasizing process improvement and project management.
Having paid $75 billion in federal taxes over the previous five yearsincluding $19 billion in 2024Apple claimed it remained among the biggest taxpayers in the United States.
Using direct employment, supplier relationships, and the iOS app economy, Apple's investment plan marks the most recent in a run of domestic growth initiatives employing 2.9 million people nationwide.

Shares of technology companies fell as traders continued to sell out of 2024 leaders.
The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund, which tracks the seven largest U.S. tech firms, is now down by almost 2% for 2025 so far, having risen by more than 30% during 2024.
Shares of Nvidia, which reports earnings later this week, fell 3% Monday and is down almost 6% for the year to date. The maker of chips for artificial-intelligence development will have even more investor attention on its earnings than previously. ""It'll be the first since DeepSeek became a household name,"" said J.D. Joyce, president of Houston financial advisory Joyce Wealth Management. ""Nvidia remains the posterchild for AI in general in my mind.""
Tesla is another major 2025 laggards, amid signs that Chief Executive Elon Musk has been distracted by his role in the Trump administration. IPhone maker Apple said it plans to spend more than $500 billion over the next four years, touting a mixture of new and existing initiatives that it said will expand its manufacturing footprint in the U.S. Apple is eager to stay out of the ""tariff crosshairs,"" said Joyce.
South African tech investor Prosus agreed to buy Anglo-Dutch food courier Just Eat Takeaway.com for $4.29 billion, using the war chest it built by selling part of its stake in Chinese Internet firm Tencent to bulk up its food-delivery arm.
In a good sign for AI investment, Anthropic is finalizing a $3.5 billion funding round that values the startup behind the chatbot Claude at $61.5 billion, showing how eager investors are to back promising AI companies despite the disruptive arrival of China's DeepSeek. Shares of AI software firm Palantir Technologies continued their recent rout and are now down by roughly 25% from highs earlier in February.

STORY: Apple said on Monday it would spend $500 billion in U.S. investments in the next four years.
The money will fund a giant factory in Texas for artificial intelligence servers and 20,000 research and development jobs across the country in that time.
It is also expected to cover spending on everything from purchases from U.S. suppliers to filming of television shows and movies for its Apple TV+ service.
Apple declined to say how much of the figure it was already planning to spend in the country.
The move comes after media reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook met President Donald Trump last week.
Many of Apple's products that are assembled in China could face 10% tariffs imposed by Trump earlier this month, though the iPhone maker had secured some waivers from China tariffs in the first Trump administration.
One analyst tells Reuters this is a political gesture toward the Trump administration.
Apple made a similar announcement about its U.S. spending plans in 2018, during the first Trump administration.
Trump, in a Truth Social post, thanked Apple and Cook, saying the move reflected the company's faith in his administration.

NEW YORK (AP) — Apple announced Monday that it plans to invest more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years, including plans to hire 20,000 people and build a new server factory in Texas.
The move comes just days after President Donald Trump said Apple CEO Tim Cook promised him that the tech giant’s manufacturing would shift from Mexico to the U.S. Trump noted the company was doing so to avoid paying tariffs. That pledge, coupled with Monday's investment commitment, came as Trump continues to threaten to impose tariffs that could drive up the cost of iPhones made in China.
“We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Cook said in a company blog post.
Apple outlined several concrete moves in its announcement, the most significant of which is the construction of a new factory in Houston — slated to open in 2026 — that will produce servers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features. The company claims this factory will create “thousands of jobs.”
The announcement is similar to one Apple made in early 2018 — during the first Trump administration — that promised to create 20,000 new jobs as part of a $350 billion spend in the U.S. Trump was also mulling a tariff then that could have affected iPhones at the time, but he didn't end up targeting those devices during his first administration.

* Futures up: Dow 0.59%, S&P 500 0.49%, Nasdaq 0.44%
Feb 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were set
to open higher on Monday, after a sharp selloff in the previous
week, while Apple dipped as the iPhone maker announced a $500
billion investment plan.
At 08:34 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 255
points, or 0.59%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 29.25 points,
or 0.49%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 95 points, or
0.44%.
Futures tracking the small-cap Russell 200 index
added 0.6%.
Most megacaps ticked higher in premarket trading, with
Alphabet up 1.9% and Meta adding 0.6%, while
Dow-listed financial stocks such as Goldman Sachs and
Visa gained about 0.9% each.
Chip stocks such as Nvidia and Micron
rose more than 1.6% each. Nvidia's quarterly results are
expected on Wednesday, putting semiconductor stocks in the
spotlight for the week.
The artificial intelligence bellwether's forecast is crucial
to investor mood on Wall Street, after the launch of low-cost AI
models from China's DeepSeek in January rattled tech stocks and
stoked doubts about U.S. dominance in the sector.
""(It will be) the company's first earnings report since
the January 27 DeepSeek-driven market selloff, when investors
started to raise serious questions about artificial intelligence
spending,"" said Clark Bellin, president and chief investment
officer at Bellwether Wealth in a note.


Apple slipped 0.8% after the iPhone maker
unveiled planned investments to help bring online a factory in
Texas by 2026 to build AI servers and add about 20,000 research
and development jobs across the U.S.
""(Apple is) moving into servers and that has not been the
area that they've succeeded in,"" said Kim Forrest, chief
investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
Futures edged up after U.S. stock indexes registered weekly
losses on Friday, as a batch of weak economic data and a
disappointing forecast from Walmart sparked concerns
that the world's largest economy was stalling. The benchmark S&P
500 and a smallcaps index marked their worst daily
declines of 2025.
On the data front, the Personal Consumption Expenditure
index - the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge - is
expected on Friday and could help markets gauge the timing of
the central bank's first rate cut this year.
Interest rate futures indicate the Fed will leave borrowing
costs unchanged for the first half of the year, according to
data compiled by LSEG.
Following Friday's soft data, markets will also be keen on
the Conference Board's report on consumer sentiment and the
second estimate on quarterly gross domestic product, due later
in the week. Remarks from at least nine Fed policymakers will
also be parsed.
Among others, Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares
rose 1% after the Warren Buffett-owned conglomerate reported a
record annual profit over the weekend.
Nike added 2.5% after Jefferies raised its rating on
the athletic apparel maker to ""buy"" from ""hold"", while Domino's
Pizza fell 4.8% after the pizza chain missed
expectations for fourth-quarter same-store sales.
Markets are also on edge for any tariff comments from U.S.
President Donald Trump, with his one-month reprieve on Mexican
and Canadian tariffs nearing its end.

By Dean Seal
Apple said it plans to spend more than $500 billion over the next four years to expand its manufacturing footprint in the U.S.
The iPhone maker pledged Monday to hire around 20,000 people during that time span and build a new factory in Houston that will create thousands of jobs.
The new 250,000-square-foot factory is slated to open in 2026 and produce servers supporting Apple Intelligence, the company's generative-AI system.
Most of the incoming wave of workers will be focused on research and development, silicon engineering, software development and AI and machine learning, Apple said.
The company said it also plans to create an academy in Michigan to train the next wave of U.S. manufacturers, and to double its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which was formed in 2017 to invest in U.S. companies that do advanced manufacturing, to $10 billion.
""We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we're proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook said.
The fund's expansion includes a multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon in a TSMC fabrication facility in Arizona, of which Apple is already the largest customer. Mass production of Apple chips began there last month, the company said.
While it is still largely dependent on East Asia, and China in particular, the Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple has been using more suppliers that manufacture in the U.S. since the pandemic.

Teams and facilities to expand in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington


Plans include a new factory in Texas, doubling the U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, a manufacturing academy, and accelerated investments in AI and silicon engineering
Apple® today announced its largest-ever spend commitment, with plans to spend and invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. This new pledge builds on Apple’s long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing, and will support a wide range of initiatives that focus on artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and skills development for students and workers across the country.
“We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “From doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we’re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we’ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.”
As part of this package of U.S. investments, Apple and partners will open a new advanced manufacturing facility in Houston to produce servers that support Apple Intelligence™, the personal intelligence system that helps users write, express themselves, and get things done. Apple will also double its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, create an academy in Michigan to train the next generation of U.S. manufacturers, and grow its research and development investments in the U.S. to support cutting-edge fields like silicon engineering.
The $500 billion commitment includes Apple’s work with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states, direct employment, Apple Intelligence infrastructure and data centers, corporate facilities, and Apple TV+® productions in 20 states. Apple remains one of the largest U.S. taxpayers, having paid more than $75 billion in U.S. taxes over the past five years, including $19 billion in 2024 alone.
Today, Apple supports more than 2.9 million jobs across the country through direct employment, work with U.S.-based suppliers and manufacturers, and developer jobs in the thriving iOS app economy.
Opening a New Manufacturing Facility in Houston
As part of its new U.S. investments, Apple will work with manufacturing partners to begin production of servers in Houston later this year. A 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility, slated to open in 2026, will create thousands of jobs.
Previously manufactured outside the U.S., the servers that will soon be assembled in Houston play a key role in powering Apple Intelligence, and are the foundation of Private Cloud Compute, which combines powerful AI processing with the most advanced security architecture ever deployed at scale for AI cloud computing. The servers bring together years of R&D by Apple engineers, and deliver the industry-leading security and performance of Apple silicon to the data center.
Teams at Apple designed the servers to be incredibly energy efficient, reducing the energy demands of Apple data centers — which already run on 100 percent renewable energy. As Apple brings Apple Intelligence to customers across the U.S., it also plans to continue expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada.
Doubling Apple’s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund
As part of this new investment, Apple is doubling its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which was created in 2017 to support world-class innovation and high-skilled manufacturing jobs across America. The growing commitment will increase the fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, focused on promoting advanced manufacturing and skills development throughout the country.
The fund’s expansion includes a multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon in TSMC’s Fab 21 facility in Arizona. Apple is the largest customer at this state-of-the-art facility, which employs more than 2,000 workers to manufacture the chips in the United States. Mass production of Apple chips began last month.
Silicon used by Apple is designed to bring Apple users incredible features, performance, and power efficiency across their devices. Apple’s suppliers already manufacture silicon in 24 factories across 12 states, including Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, and Utah. The company’s investments in the sector help create thousands of high-paying jobs across the country at U.S. companies like Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Skyworks, and Qorvo.
To date, Apple’s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund has supported projects in 13 states — including Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Indiana — that have helped build local businesses, train workers, and create a wide range of innovative manufacturing processes and materials for Apple products.
Growing R&D Investments Across the U.S.
Apple continues to expand its R&D across the U.S. In the past five years, Apple has nearly doubled its U.S.-based advanced R&D spend, and it will continue to accelerate its growth.
Recently, Apple announced the newest addition to its iPhone® lineup, iPhone 16e. iPhone 16e delivers fast, smooth performance and breakthrough battery life, thanks to the industry-leading efficiency of the A18 chip and the new Apple C1 — the first cellular modem designed by Apple, and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone. Apple C1 adds a new chapter to the story of Apple silicon and is the result of years of R&D investment, bringing together the work of thousands of engineers. Apple C1 is the start of a long-term strategy that will allow Apple to innovate and optimize the modem system for additional Apple products.
In the next four years, Apple plans to hire around 20,000 people, of which the vast majority will be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning. The expanded commitment includes significant investment in Apple’s R&D hubs across the country. This includes growing teams across the U.S. focused on areas including custom silicon, hardware engineering, software development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
Supporting American Businesses with a New Manufacturing Academy in Detroit
To help companies transition to advanced manufacturing, Apple will open the Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. Apple engineers, along with experts from top universities such as Michigan State, will consult with small- and medium-sized businesses on implementing AI and smart manufacturing techniques. The academy will also offer free in-person and online courses, with a skills development curriculum that teaches workers vital skills like project management and manufacturing process optimization. The courses will help drive productivity, efficiency, and quality in companies’ supply chains.
Apple has long been committed to investing in education and skills development for American workers and students. That includes ongoing and expanding grant programs for organizations like 4-H, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and FIRST, which work closely with Apple in communities across the country to create free programming that helps young people learn vital skills like coding.
Apple’s support for the next generation of innovators also includes efforts like the company’s New Silicon Initiative, which prepares students for careers in hardware engineering and silicon chip design. Last year, this program expanded to students at Georgia Tech, and it now reaches students at eight schools across the country. Apple is continuing to expand the initiative, including a new collaboration with UCLA’s Center for Education of Microchip Designers (CEMiD) beginning this year.

Shares of technology companies fell as traders retreated from high-risk momentum sectors due to rising volatility.
""I think it's big deal that we're losing our leader,"" said Jim Paulsen, who now publishes an independent newsletter. ""The Magnificent Seven are down year-to-date and underperforming on a relative basis for the last four months...it's hard for me to believe we're going to change [market] leadership without any bumps in the road.""
The CBOE volatility index, or VIX, also known as the stock market's fear gauge because it measures the premium paid for protective options, shot up by 18%.
Apple removed its Advanced Data Protection feature in the U.K. after the government reportedly requested access to user data stored on its iCloud service.
""While we remain positive on global equities supported by resilient US growth and AI tailwinds, a smooth journey up is unlikely,"" said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer of global equities at money manager UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note to clients.

UPDATE
Apple Intelligence on iPhone, iPad, and Mac expands to more languages and regions in April
Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence, will soon be available in more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) - as well as localized English for Singapore and India.
These new languages will be accessible in nearly all regions around the world with the release of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 in April, and developers can start to test these releases today.
With the upcoming software updates, iPhone and iPad users in the EU will have access to Apple Intelligence features for the first time, and Apple Intelligence will expand to a new platform in U.S. English with Apple Vision Pro - helping users communicate, collaborate, and express themselves in entirely new ways.
Apple Intelligence marks an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI and is designed to protect users' privacy at every step. It starts with on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power Apple Intelligence run entirely on the device. For requests that require access to larger models, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence.
Apple Intelligence will continue to expand with new features in the coming months, including more capabilities for Siri.

LONDON (AP) — Apple said Friday it will stop offering an advanced data security option for British users after the government reportedly demanded that the company provide backdoor access for any data those users have stored in the cloud.
The iPhone maker said its Advanced Data Protection encryption feature is no longer available for new users in the United Kingdom and will eventually be disabled for existing users.
Advanced Data Protection, which Apple started rolling out at the end of 2022, is an opt-in feature that protects iCloud files, photos, notes and other data with end-to-end encryption when they're stored in the cloud.
British security officials demanded in a secret order that the U.S. tech giant create so-called backdoor access so that they could view fully encrypted material, The Washington Post reported earlier this month, citing anonymous sources.
Apple “can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection” in the U.K., the company said in a statement.
“We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,” Apple said, without referring to the government demand.
The Washington Post report said the British government served Apple with what's known as a “technical capability notice"" ordering it to provide the access under a sweeping law called the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which has been dubbed the snoopers' charter.
The law officially gives British spies the ability to hack into devices and harvest vast amounts of bulk online data, much of it from outside the U.K. It contains provisions to compel companies to remove encryption to allow for electronic eavesdropping, while making it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has issued such demands.
“We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,"" the U.K. Home Office said in a brief statement.
Apple did not reveal how many users in Britain have been using Advanced Data Protection. It said the feature would still be available to users in the rest of the world.
Some types of data will still be end-to-end encrypted in the U.K. by default, Apple said, including passwords on the iCloud Keychain, information on the Health app, and communications on services including iMessage and FaceTime.
End-to-end encryption means that messages are scrambled so that only the sender and recipient can see them. If anyone else intercepts the message, all they will see is a garble that can’t be unscrambled without the key.
The episode illustrates “one of the fundamental flaws in government efforts to undermine encryption,"" said Mike Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. Faced with having to choose between security and complying with government regulations, companies like Apple tend to remove security features entirely, said Chapple, a former computer scientist at the National Security Agency.
“The net effect is reduced security for everyone. If other governments follow the UK’s lead, we risk a future where strong encryption is functionally outlawed, which puts all of us at risk not just to government surveillance but also to eavesdropping by other bad actors.”

AAPL

Following the launch of the CMA's first round of Strategic Market Status investigations into Apple and Google, we take a look at the nature of the concerns the CMA is investigating and consider what its announcements to date tell us about the way in which it intends to operate the new digital markets competition regime.
Introduction
With the entry into force of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA) on 1 January 2025, the CMA can designate large tech firms as having ""Strategic Market Status"" (SMS) when those firms hold ""substantial and entrenched market power"" and occupy a ""position of strategic significance"" in in relation to one or more digital activities. Once designated, the CMA can impose ""conduct requirements"" (CRs) on those firms, and/or introduce ""pro-competition interventions"" (PCIs) to address the root causes of their market power and ensure that digital markets are open to competition and achieve positive outcomes for UK consumers and businesses.
As discussed in our previous article, earlier this year the CMA gave a strong indication of how it intends to deploy its new powers in practice. This came in the form of detailed Guidance and a statement on the expected sequencing of its initial rounds of SMS investigations.
Since then, we have, as expected, had two rounds of announcements of SMS investigations from the CMA: the first into Google's search business; and the second, two weeks later, into Google and Apple's mobile ecosystems. These were accompanied by public Investigation Notices addressed to Google and Apple, setting out the CMA's grounds for believing the SMS criteria may be met, and by detailed Invitations to Comment (ITC) for the benefit of third-party stakeholders.
The investigations
General search services
The first SMS investigation, launched on 14 January 2025, targets Google's ""general search and search advertising services"". These comprise two distinct sets of products:
The CMA notes that these distinct activities are carried out in combination for the common purpose of operating Google's general search engine, which can be viewed as a two-sided platform that offers free general search services to users, financed through the sale of search advertising to businesses. The CMA therefore considers that these services may be grouped together as a single ""digital activity"" under the DMCCA for the purposes of designating Google as having SMS.
The CMA's investigation will therefore assess the extent of competition between Google and its rivals on both the user and advertiser sides of the market, and seek to identify barriers to entry and expansion. The CMA will also explore potential interventions to promote competition and reduce those barriers, and prevent Google from leveraging its market power in search into other services and/or engaging in conduct that exploits users and advertisers. These could include CRs ensuring challenger search services can access key default positions on Google's search engine results page (SERP), forcing Google to make key data available to competitors, and restricting Google's ability to share user data across its different services.
Mobile ecosystems
The CMA's second and third investigations, jointly announced on 23 January 2025, examine whether Apple and Google should be designated with SMS in relation to their mobile ecosystems, covering the provision of:
The CMA considers that these three digital activities may be carried out in combination for the purpose of facilitating interactions between mobile device users and providers of digital content (in the form of mobile apps and web content). Accordingly, the CMA is, as part of its ITC, seeking views on whether there should be a grouped designation, with a 'mobile ecosystem' constituting a single digital activity.
The SMS investigations will assess the extent of Apple and Google's market power and the potential competitive constraints they face in respect of these activities, including the presence of barriers to entry and expansion, competitive dynamics between the iOS and Android operating systems, and the influence of Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store on app design and distribution.
The CMA will also examine how the role and design of mobile browsers and browser engines - particularly Apple's Safari and WebKit, and Google's Chrome and Blink - shape user access to online content and services, including web apps (which can provide some of the same functionality as ""native"" apps, but run via a mobile browser), and how the configuration of iOS/Android impacts on the competitive landscape for mobile browsers and browser engines.
In parallel, the CMA will explore potential CRs to address issues arising from such market power. These are likely to focus on practices at the operating system level that impact competition at the browser and/or app store level (which is perhaps also why the CMA is considering whether 'mobile ecosystem' should be the relevant digital activity). Other interventions could include measures to promote switching between iOS and Android devices, forcing Apple and Google to allow alternative app stores and payment methods, and fair and transparent app review processes.
Key takeaways
The investigations are at a very early stage, but the CMA's announcements (which, whilst not as voluminous as a typical market study Statement of Scope, provide a lot more detail than announcements of antitrust investigations) already provide an indication of what lies in store and how the CMA is likely to wield its powers under the new regime.
Unfinished business?
One immediate observation is that the CMA, through these new interventions, is finally seeking to address concerns it identified some time ago in previous investigations, notably its:
For the CMA, a chief advantage of taking remedial action under its new powers is the possibility of ensuring that the concerns it has identified across a range of markets are addressed more holistically, taking into account the links and inter-dependencies between different underlying digital services and products. Additionally, the new regime is inherently forward-looking and iterative, allowing the CMA to refine its interventions over time to keep pace with technological and market developments and address possible circumvention by designated firms.
Are findings of SMS a foregone conclusion?
In each of the above-mentioned market studies/investigations, which it intends to draw upon, the CMA concluded that Apple and/or Google enjoyed significant market power in respect of the products under scrutiny (in some, the CMA described that market power as being ""substantial and entrenched"") or had reasonable grounds to suspect that they were dominant.
Consequently, while the CMA has reiterated that the outcomes of the SMS investigations have not been pre-judged, and that the qualitative legal test for a finding of SMS is distinct from any similar concepts under competition law, Apple and Google will face an uphill battle to convince the CMA that they do not benefit from substantial and entrenched market power and a position of strategic significance.
The CMA will, however, still have to establish that the position has not materially shifted since the findings of its previous investigations were reached, up to five years ago, and that there is nothing to suggest that the position will shift in the next five years.
Front-loading remedy design
A key element of the CMA's pronouncements around the turn of the year (including the revisions incorporated in its final Guidance document) was its aim to impose CRs at the same time as designating the first SMS firms, or very shortly thereafter.
The recent investigation announcements further emphasise this aim. Indeed, the relevant CMA case pages make clear that the CR imposition process set out in the Guidance, including the various consultative steps therein, is being carried out in parallel with the SMS designation process, following the same administrative timetable.
We can, therefore, expect a large part of the present investigations to focus on identifying, designing and consulting upon appropriate CRs, with initial draft CRs to be published in June 2025. Again, the CMA will here be able to draw on its previous work, including the extensive work carried out on remedies as part of the MBMI. But this will still be a substantial undertaking, given the range of products in scope of the investigations (each of which could require multiple CRs) and the diverging stakeholder interests the CMA will need to grapple with.
A flexible and forward-looking regime
The first wave of SMS investigations illustrates the inherent flexibility of the UK's digital markets competition regime.
Most notably, the CMA has been quick to deploy its ability to group distinct activities into one digital activity for SMS investigation purposes - something that is not possible under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is based on a more rigid framework, where each core platform service must be assessed and designated separately. To group the activities in this way, the CMA will need to establish that the relevant legal test (i.e. that the activities have a substantially similar purpose, or can be carried out in combination for a specific purpose) is met.
The main motivators for the CMA in seeking to group activities in this way appear to be a desire to: (i) look at the various activities holistically through one investigation (taking into account the interplay between the various components of the SMS firms' ecosystems); and (ii) move quickly in imposing CRs that address concerns across multiple markets, in a way that is administratively manageable.
Another element that comes to the fore in the ITCs is the forward-looking nature of the assessment the CMA intends to carry out. Not only is this required by the SMS criteria (as for substantial market power to be ""entrenched"", the CMA must consider the competitive position over the next five years), but the CMA also appears to be looking to identify CRs that can prevent harms that have not yet arisen. This is particularly evident in its focus on the competition that generative AI services and AI interfaces might be able to provide in online search, as these nascent technologies continue to mature at pace.
Here again a contrast can be drawn with traditional antitrust enforcement, which focuses on existing harms and/or conduct, and with the DMA's more rigid rulebook, under which the conduct obligations address known and present concerns and can only be modified by the Commission after a detailed market investigation and subject to certain pre-defined parameters.
The CMA will no doubt hope that, by anticipating future market dynamics, it can implement proactive measures to foster competition and protect consumers and businesses over the coming years of continued technological development. What remains to be seen is the extent to which this results in the CMA's CRs supplementing and/or diverging from the DMA's conduct obligations, the impact such additional regulatory layer and/or potential divergence may have on market outcomes, and also whether the CMA will be as quick as the Commission to investigate alleged non-compliance with such requirements.
What next?
Over the next few months, the CMA will focus on evidence-gathering, through the submission of information requests to, and by holding roundtables and bilateral meetings with, the potential SMS firms and relevant third parties.
The CMA will then publicly consult upon its proposed SMS designation decisions and CRs in July 2025. This will allow the CMA to consider the representations and feedback it receives in response to the consultation, as well as conduct further evidence-gathering, ahead of the statutory deadline for SMS designation in October 2025 (the CMA can unilaterally extend this deadline by three months if it considers it has ""special reasons"" to do so).
We can also expect the CMA to announce at least one more SMS investigation towards the middle of the year.

Copyright © BusinessAMBE 2023
Apple yesterday introduced the latest iPhone in the iPhone 16 series. It has become the iPhone 16e. This new model replaces the affordable iPhone SE. It is quite a bit cheaper than the most affordable iPhone 16, but at the same time more expensive than the previous iPhone SE budget models.
Key Takeaways
Yesterday, Apple presented their new iPhone 16e. This new model thus enters the iPhone 16 series. The iPhone 16e has a price tag of 719 euros (128GB). This makes it a lot cheaper than the cheapest model in the iPhone 16 series (from 969 euros), but it is more expensive than the previous iPhone SE budget models (in 2022: 529 euros). ""The competitive price of this new addition puts iPhone within reach of even more people,"" Kaiann Drance, Vice President of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing at Apple, said in the press release. The new iPhone replaces the iPhone SE, which until now has been the cheapest model of all iPhones.
Created for Apple Intelligence
The phone will be available for sale in two colors and you can choose from 128-, 256- or 512-gigabyte storage capacities. The fingerprint scanner has been replaced by facial recognition. Charging is now done via a USB-C cable. We find only one camera at the back of the iPhone 16e. So there are no cameras inside specifically made for zooming or taking landscape photos. You can charge the phone wirelessly, but there is no MagSafe, the system for magnetically connecting the wireless charger and other accessories to the phone.
""The iPhone 16e is made for Apple Intelligence, which enables all sorts of nifty new things on your iPhone,"" Apple reports in their press release. ""ChatGPT is integrated into Siri and Writing Help, so you can have even more expertise at your fingertips without having to switch tools.""
End of speculation
With this announcement of the new iPhone, speculation can end. For months there was speculation about what Apple would launch on Feb. 19, 2025. Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook sprinkled some more oil on the fire. The Apple boss announced on X that a new product was going to be presented on Feb. 19. This caused speculation to skyrocket. Many people already thought there was going to be a successor to the iPhone SE. Only it was not clear what it would be called.
Cook cited in his X post that people should get ready for ""the newest member of the family."" By this he was referring, according to many people, to the iPhone 16 family. After a long time of uncertainty, there is now clarity. The iPhone 16e will go on sale Feb. 28.

Copyright © Emerce 2023
As expected, Apple today announced the iPhone 16e, a new addition to the iPhone 16 series. It is also Apple's first budget Apple Intelligence-capable device thanks to its A18 chip.
The iPhone 16e is splash, water and dust resistant and meets resistance standard IP68. The Ceramic Shield glass on the front is stronger than any other smartphone glass, according to Apple.
The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display with OLED technology runs edge-to-edge. iPhone 16e also has the very best battery life for an iPhone of this size: the battery lasts up to 6 hours longer than that of iPhone 11 and up to 12 hours longer than that of all iPhone SE models. The TrueDepth camera system also enables Face ID, for securely unlocking your iPhone, making purchases or logging into apps.
The CPU has 6 cores and is up to 80 percent faster than iPhone 11's A13 Bionic chip. Also new is the C1, the first modem developed by Apple itself. This is also immediately the most energy-efficient modem yet in an iPhone.
The powerful 2-in-1 camera system on iPhone 16e captures small and big moments, according to Apple. The 48-MP Fusion camera uses computational photography to capture super-high-resolution photos in which light and detail are ""beautifully balanced. The TrueDepth front-facing autofocus camera should guarantee sharper close-ups and beautiful group selfies. The latest generation of HDR accurately captures the subject and background, with natural skin tones and balanced rendering of whites, shadows and everything in between.
iPhone 16e is available in white and black with 128GB, 256GB or 512GB storage starting at $719.
Ordering is possible as early as Friday, Feb. 21, after which this model will be available starting Friday, Feb. 28.

Apple has released a sleeker and more expensive version of its lowest priced iPhone in an attempt to widen the audience for a bundle of artificial intelligence technology that the company has been hoping will revive demand for its most profitable product lineup.
The iPhone 16e unveiled Wednesday is the fourth-generation of a model that’s sold at a dramatically lower price than the iPhone’s standard and premium models. The previous bargain-bin models were called the iPhone SE, with the last version coming out in 2022.
Like the higher-priced iPhone 16 lineup unveiled last September, the iPhone 16e includes the souped-up computer chip needed to process an array of AI features that automatically summarize text, audio and create on-the-fly emojis while smartening up the device’s virtual assistant, Siri. It will also have a more powerful battery and camera.
All those upgrades will translate into a higher starting price for an iPhone 16e at $600, a 40% increase from $430 for the last iPhone SE. But iPhone 16e will be more affordable than the cheapest standard iPhone 16 at $800. The new phone will be available in stores Feb. 28, but can be pre-ordered beginning Friday.
“We’re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people,” said Kaiann Drance, an Apple vice president in charge of promoting a device lineup that accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.
Although Apple has been hyping its foray into AI since last June, the complete set of features still haven’t been released in the U.S. and the technology still isn’t even available in some parts of the world.
The delays in making the iPhone’s AI — dubbed “Apple Intelligence’"" — more widely available through free software updates dinged the Cupertino, California, company during the past holiday when sales of the device dipped slightly from their 2023 levels.
Apple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasn’t yet specified when the iPhone's AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring.
Besides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do.
Apple's shares edged up during Wednesday's late mornng trading to nearly $245, below the stock's peak price of roughly $260 reached in late December.

LONDON - Emburse, whose leading travel and expense solutions power forward-thinking organizations, today brings Apple Pay to UK customers. Cardholders who live in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland can now add Emburse Cards to their Apple Wallet and make purchases in-person or online wherever tap or Apple Wallet is accepted. It's a safer, more secure and private way to pay that helps customers avoid handing their payment card to someone else, touching physical buttons or exchanging cash - and uses the power of iPhone to protect every transaction.
An Emburse Card is a corporate card that comes with built-in controls. The card gives businesses greater visibility over spending than traditional corporate cards. Organizations can set customisable spending limits and assign unique budgets for each card as well as restrict purchases at specific merchants or categories. An Emburse Card can be pre-configured with these controls and gives organizations a greater understanding of employee spending compared to cash or a personal card. Integration with Apple Pay means that adoption of an Emburse Card becomes effortless, providing businesses with fast and convenient contactless payments without needing a physical card.
To use an Emburse Card with Apple Pay, customers simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near a payment terminal to make a contactless payment. Every Apple Pay purchase is secure because it is authenticated with Face ID, Touch ID, or device passcode, as well as a one-time unique dynamic security code. Apple Pay is accepted in grocery stores, pharmacies, taxis, restaurants, coffee shops, retail stores, and many more places.
Customers can also use Apple Pay on iPhone, iPad, and Mac to make faster and more convenient purchases in apps or on the web in Safari without having to create accounts or repeatedly type in shipping and billing information. Apple Pay makes it easier to pay for food and grocery deliveries, online shopping, transportation, and parking, among other things. Apple Pay can also be used to make payments in apps on Apple Watch.
Security and privacy are at the core of Apple Pay. When customers use a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted, and securely stored in the Secure Element, an industry-standard, certified chip designed to store the payment information safely on the device.
Apple Pay is easy to set up. On iPhone, simply open the Wallet app, tap +, and follow the steps to add Emburse Cards. Once a customer adds a card to iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac, they can start using Apple Pay on that device right away. Customers will continue to receive all of the rewards and benefits offered by Emburse Cards.

iPhone 16e is powered by Apple’s latest-generation A18 chip, which enables fast, smooth performance, incredible power efficiency, and Apple Intelligence. The 6-core CPU is up to 80 percent faster than the A13 Bionic chip on iPhone 11, handling both everyday and intensive tasks with ease — from simple workloads, to more demanding actions with Apple Intelligence. The 4-core GPU powers stunning graphics performance and unlocks next-level mobile gaming on the go, enabling graphically demanding AAA titles and hardware-accelerated ray tracing for more realistic lighting and reflections. The 16-core Neural Engine is optimized for large generative models and runs machine learning (ML) models up to 6x faster than A13 Bionic.
Expanding the benefits of Apple silicon, C1 is the first modem designed by Apple and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone, delivering fast and reliable 5G cellular connectivity. Apple silicon — including C1 — the all-new internal design, and the advanced power management of iOS 18 all contribute to extraordinary battery life.
Built for Apple Intelligence
iPhone 16e is built for Apple Intelligence, unlocking exciting new capabilities that make iPhone even more helpful and powerful. With the Clean Up tool, it’s easy to remove distracting elements in images, and natural language search in the Photos app allows users to search for just about any photo or video by simply describing what they are looking for.
Users can also explore creative new ways to express themselves visually with Image Playground™, create the perfect emoji with Genmoji™, and make their writing even more dynamic with Writing Tools. They can now type to Siri®, and Siri is more conversational with the ability to follow along if users stumble over their words. Siri can also maintain context from one request to the next. With extensive product knowledge, Siri can answer thousands of questions about the features and settings of Apple products, so users can learn how to do things like take a screen recording or schedule a text message to send later.
With access to ChatGPT seamlessly integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, users can choose to access ChatGPT’s expertise without jumping between applications, so they can get things done faster and easier than ever before. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in — their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won’t store requests. Users can choose whether to enable ChatGPT integration, and are in full control of when to use it and what information is shared with ChatGPT.
Apple Intelligence marks an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI and is designed to protect users’ privacy at every step. It starts with on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power Apple Intelligence run entirely on device. For requests that require access to larger models, Apple’s groundbreaking Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request.
Access Favorite Features and Unlock Visual Intelligence with the Action Button
iPhone 16e features the Action button, allowing users to easily access a variety of functions with just a press. Once customized in Settings, the Action button can be used to quickly open the camera or flashlight; switch between Ring and Silent modes; recognize music with Shazam®; activate Voice Memos, Focus, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier; or use Shortcuts for more options. The Action button can even access in-app functionality like launching the camera in Snapchat, unlocking a car door with FordPass, tracking a child’s sleep schedule with Napper, and more.
The Action button on iPhone 16e also unlocks a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence to help users learn about objects and places. Visual intelligence can summarize and copy text, translate text between languages, detect phone numbers or email addresses with the option to add to contacts, identify an animal or plant, and more. Visual intelligence also allows users to search Google so they can see where they can buy an item, or benefit from ChatGPT’s problem-solving skills. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared.
A Powerful Camera System to Capture Any Moment
The powerful 2-in-1 camera system on iPhone 16e is perfect for capturing everyday moments and important memories, including in Night mode and Portrait mode. Using computational photography, the 48MP Fusion camera takes super-high-resolution photos, so users can capture gorgeous images that balance light and detail. With an integrated 2x Telephoto, users have the equivalent of two cameras in one, and can zoom in with optical quality to get closer to the subject and easily frame their shot. And the front-facing TrueDepth camera with autofocus enables sharper close-ups and beautiful group selfies. The latest generation of HDR captures subjects and the background with true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have bright highlights, rich mid-tones, and deep shadows.
iPhone 16e takes stunning videos with the ability to record in 4K with Dolby Vision up to 60 fps, and users can stop and restart a recording for more flexibility when capturing the moment. iPhone 16e also records video in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods®, Apple Vision Pro™, or a surround sound system, and enables more ways to edit video sound with Audio Mix. Users can adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful ML algorithms automatically reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality.
Groundbreaking Safety and Communication Capabilities
iPhone 16e helps users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most. Apple’s satellite features help users text via satellite when they’re outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. This includes Messages via satellite to text friends and family; Emergency SOS via satellite to connect with emergency services; and Roadside Assistance via satellite to reach a roadside assistance provider in case of car trouble. Users can also use the Find My app to share their location via satellite, reassuring friends and family of their whereabouts while traveling off the grid. Crash Detection on iPhone 16e can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services if a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone.5
Featuring iOS 18
iOS 18 makes iPhone 16e more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever.6 With more customization options, users can give apps and widgets a new dark or tinted look and arrange them in any open space on the Home Screen. The controls at the bottom of the Lock Screen can be customized; Control Center has been redesigned to provide users with easier access to many of the things they use every day, including third-party apps; and new privacy protections include the ability to lock and hide apps to protect sensitive apps and the information inside them. iOS 18 also provides powerful updates for staying connected. In Messages, users can use text effects to bring words, phrases, sentences, and more to life. Tapbacks expand to include emoji, Genmoji, or stickers, and now users can schedule a message to send later. When messaging contacts who do not have an Apple device, the Messages app now supports RCS for richer media and more reliable group messaging when compared to SMS and MMS.
Better for the Environment
iPhone 16e is designed with the environment in mind. As part of Apple 2030, the company’s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is transitioning to renewable electricity for its manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to charge all Apple products, including iPhone 16e. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity — including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence.
To achieve Apple 2030, the company is designing products with more recycled and renewable materials, which further drives down the carbon footprint. iPhone 16e features over 30 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled cobalt and 95 percent recycled lithium in the battery, 85 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, and more.7 Additionally, the main logic board and back glass of iPhone 16e are designed to be manufactured more efficiently, reducing the amount of raw materials needed. The packaging is also entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of removing plastic from its packaging by the end of this year.8

Why Trademarking a Logo is Important
Logos are valuable business assets uniquely capable of representing and generating goodwill for your company, business, or brand. Often, significant amounts of time and money are spent in the creation, development, and implementation of a company logo. However, many business owners are unsure about how to trademark a logo and what steps to take for federal registration. Is it really necessary to register a company logo with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (""USPTO"")? If so, what are the most common pitfalls and what can a business do to ensure a smoother process to registration? The answers to these questions will differ from case to case, but there are some common pitfalls and keys to success that apply to most cases.
Do I Really Need to Register My Company's Logo with the USPTO?
As with all trademark rights, the actual right in and to the intellectual property arises out of the use of the mark - here, the logo. Thus, if you design the logo and then use it on behalf of your company, you have trademark rights in and to that mark. (As an aside, if you commission the creation of the mark, or pay another to design the mark for your company, you will need to ensure a transfer of the ownership in the mark to your company from the third-party designer). This is known as having ""common-law trademark rights."" However, federal registration of a trademark with the USPTO confers additional rights and protections not available under common law. For example, registration of a logo with the USPTO on the Principal Register offers the following benefits and protections:
Given these benefits and the costs associated with developing a company logo, federal registration is usually advisable.
What Are the Common Pitfalls to Registering a Logo?
As with all trademarks - whether a word or design mark - there are common traps that can prevent federal registration, including the use of a generic or descriptive mark, choosing a mark too similar to another registered mark, incorporating or including geographically descriptive elements in your mark, a merely ornamental mark, or failing to properly classify your goods and/or services.
Generic or Descriptive Marks
Marks that are considered ""generic"" are not entitled to trademark protection and cannot be registered with the USPTO. In the context of a logo, this could be a fruit juice company whose logo is a generic apple or a shoe company utilizing basic clip art of a sneaker. Similarly, a descriptive or geographically descriptive logo is one that includes textual or other visual images or components that communicate the type of goods or services associated with the mark or the geographic location or region where goods or services are to be offered under the mark. For example, if the Apple computer logo were used in connection with an apple orchard or applesauce company, it could be refused registration on the basis that it is too descriptive of the goods and services to be offered under the mark. A logo that merely incorporates a business's name and location runs the risk of the same outcome. Conversely, the use of the Apple logo in connection with computers was completely arbitrary (prior to its fame) and would not be considered descriptive. The important thing to consider in designing a logo is that it must contain unique or creative elements that consumers will come to associate with your goods or services without telling your consumers what those goods and services are. For this reason, it is often a good idea to avoid commonly used icons or even emojis when designing a logo. Creating distinctive graphical elements and/or characters within a logo will result in a much stronger mark and increase your chances of securing federal registration.
Choosing a Logo Too Similar to a Registered Mark
Since the purpose of trademark protections is to allow the owner of a trademarked logo to protect its mark from copying or counterfeit use by another, attempting to register a mark that is too similar to an existing federally registered logo will trip you up and can result in a refusal to register your mark. This can be true even if the mark you have created is truly unique and creative. If someone else has already used a similar logo in connection with the same or similar goods or services, your registration is likely to be refused. Determining whether existing federally registered logos are similar to your own can be tricky and this, perhaps more than any other aspect of registering a logo, can be the most challenging. Depending on the size and scope of your intended use of the logo, it is usually advisable that you consult with an intellectual property attorney prior to adopting and launching a logo to help ensure you are not unwittingly infringing an existing mark. IP attorneys are trained in how to run a search of existing logos and can help identify ensure complete and accurate results of most value and interpret those results into opinions on risk of use and registration. Identifying similar marks early in the process will allow you to make modifications to distinguish your logo from the existing registrations and can ensure a much less complicated process to registration.
Choosing a Mark That Is Merely Ornamental
The process of registering a logo as a trademark involves not only the general appearance of the logo, itself, but also how the mark is used. To constitute ""use"" for purposes of trademark registration, the mark must be in commerce and visible on goods or, with regard to services, must be visible at the point of sale - as in on a website where the services can be purchased. A mark or use of a mark is considered ""merely ornamental"" and may be refused registration on that basis if the logo is used to adorn a product - clothing, a journal, pens, etc. - but does not appear to point to the source of the product. This often occurs in the context of clothing where a logo appears on the front of a t-shirt but cannot be distinguished from any other design portrayed on clothing. Usually, this can be avoided by including the logo in the tag sewn into the item of clothing or including a hang tag clearly demarking that logo as representing the source of the t-shirt.
Failing to Properly Classify Goods or Services
Yet another common pitfall in attempting to register a company logo is failing to properly classify the goods or services associated that the logo. When submitting a trademark application to the USPTO, the owner of the mark must identify the specific classes—or categories—of goods and/or services on which it is or intends to use the applied-for-mark. There are 45 total classes - Classes 1 through 34 cover goods and Classes 35 through 45 apply to services. As an initial matter, choosing the correct categories is essential to ensuring you have adequate protection over all the ways in which you use or intend to use your mark; if you are using the mark in a way that is not described in your application and registration, you may not have protection over that use. Still further, properly classifying your goods and services is necessary to efficiently navigate the registration process as well. If the Examiner assigned to review your application believes the wrong classes have been identified, it can delay registration. And if your application is ever found to contain inaccurate information, you could be denied or lose your registration. This is another aspect of the trademark registration process where you may be best served to work with a knowledgeable trademark attorney.
Keys to Success
In light of these common obstacles to registration, what can you do to ensure your path to registration is as efficient and successful as possible? The keys to successfully registering a logo can include the following: (1) consulting a trademark attorney from the beginning and involving them in logo selection, (2) conducting a trademark search (or having your attorney conduct one) to avoid selecting a logo that is too similar to a registered mark, and (3) clearly defining your use of the logo and ensuring that you continue to use it consistently and accurately throughout the application process.
Consult a Trademark Attorney to Ensure Your Logo is Neither Generic Nor Descriptive
Registering a company logo can present unique challenges, particularly since the descriptive type of logo that is most easily recognized and identified by consumers (from a marketing perspective) may be refused registration if it is too descriptive or even generic. Working with a trademark attorney from the development stage can help you navigate this dichotomy and ensure you design a logo that is easily recognizable while also registrable.
Run a Trademark Search for Similar Logos
As mentioned above, searching for other uses of a logo can prove challenging. Still, conducting your due diligence is necessary to ensure that you do not select a logo that not only may be difficult to register, but could subject you to penalties for trademark infringement. Most trademark attorneys have training and experience specific to searching for logos and other graphic art and are likely the best situated to assist with this important step. Depending on the results of any given search, your attorney can assist in revising or revamping the logo to avoid confusion with an existing mark, both in an effort to make the registration process smoother and to increase your chances of successfully obtaining registration.
Define Your Use Accurately and Use the Logo Consistently
Finally, consulting with a trademark attorney to determine the proper scope of your use or intended use related to a logo, and ensuring the categories of goods or services are properly and accurately identified in the application, will go a long way toward avoiding unnecessary speed bumps in the registration process.
Additionally, as important as properly defining the scope of your use is the need to ensure proper and consistent use of your logo throughout the registration process. For example, when a logo includes text, all use of the logo going forward must include the same text, in the same location in relation to any graphic or other images. That means that if your application consists of an image with specific text to the left of the image, your use of the logo going forward must always show the text to the left of the image. This is because any material alteration to a logo renders it a new logo in the eyes of the USPTO. A scenario we encounter frequently involves a marketing department's update to a company's website that includes ""tweaks"" to the company logo while an application for that logo is pending. Depending on how the logo is altered, the Examiner may see the revised image on the website while reviewing the application and reject it on the basis of ""no use in commerce.""
While navigating the process of federal trademark registration for a company logo can be tricky, avoiding the common pitfalls and utilizing these keys to success can help ensure your process is as efficient as possible and, ultimately, increase your odds of securing registration.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -     Nine people were arrested during a raucous demonstration outside a New York City Tesla dealership on Saturday, protesting owner Elon Musk's role in sweeping cuts to the federal workforce at the behest of President Donald Trump.
The protest, which police said involved hundreds of people, was one of a wave of ""Tesla Takedown"" demonstrations staged across the country targeting billionaire Musk, who is spearheading the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
Throngs of protesters also descended on the electric vehicle maker's showrooms in Jacksonville, Florida, Tucson, Arizona, and other cities, blocking traffic, chanting and waving signs reading ""Burn a Tesla: Save Democracy,"" and ""No Dictators in the USA.""
Musk, the world's richest person, is leading an unprecedented push to shrink the federal government that has resulted in the firing of thousands of employees and the termination of hundreds of aid contracts and federal leases.
Tesla and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to attempts to seek comment by phone and email on Saturday night.
In some cases, federal agencies have been forced to try to hire back key workers that had been fired, including some responsible for America's nuclear weapons, scientists trying to fight a worsening outbreak of bird flu and officials responsible for supplying electricity.
At least 100,000 of the 2.3 million federal employees have agreed to buy-outs or have been fired since Trump took office on January 20.
""We are taking action at Tesla, Musk's flagship company,"" the organizers said on the website actionnetwork.org, calling for people to dump Tesla stock and ""join the picket lines.""
""Detaching Musk from Tesla would be a meaningful blow against this administration and its prerogatives, because it would be a strike against what they hold most dear: money and power,"" actor and filmmaker Alex Winter wrote in a Rolling Stone article. Winter has posted on social media that he helped organize the protests.

BOSTON (AP) — Demonstrators gathered outside Tesla stores across the U.S. Saturday to protest the automaker's billionaire CEO, Elon Musk, and his push to slash government spending on behalf of President Donald Trump.
The demonstrations are part of a growing backlash in North America and Europe to Musk's disruptive role in Washington.
Critics of Trump and Musk hope to discourage and stigmatize purchases of Tesla, the electric car company that is the world's most valuable automaker. Liberal groups for weeks have organized anti-Tesla protests in hopes of galvanizing opposition to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and energizing Democrats still demoralized by Trump's November victory.
“We can get back at Elon,” said Nathan Phillips, a 58-year-old ecologist from Newton, Massachusetts, who was protesting in Boston on Saturday. “We can impose direct economic damage on Tesla by showing up at showrooms everywhere and boycotting Tesla and telling everyone else to get out, sell your stocks, sell your Teslas.”
Musk is taking direction from Trump to slash federal spending and sharply reduce the workforce, arguing that Trump's victory gave the president and him a mandate to restructure the U.S. government. DOGE officials have swiftly gained access to sensitive databases, directed thousands of federal job cuts, canceled contracts and shut down sections of the government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development.
Musk's critics say his actions defy Congress's power to control the U.S. budget and present a host of ways for him to enrich himself. Musk leads several other companies, notably SpaceX, which conducts launches for NASA and the intelligence community, and the social media platform X.
“Protests will not deter President Trump and Elon Musk from delivering on the promise to establish DOGE and make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers across the country,"" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.
Tesla did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
More than 50 demonstrations were listed Saturday on the website Tesla Takedown, with more planned later in March from coast to coast in the United States along with England, Spain and Portugal. News reports showed demonstrations in recent days in U.S. cities including Tucson, Arizona; St. Louis; New York City; Dayton, Ohio; Charlotte; and Palo Alto, California.
Some Tesla owners have also reported their vehicles vandalized with spray painted swastikas amid what Jewish groups and observers fear is a rise in antisemitism.
Federal prosecutors charged a woman in connection with a string of vandalism against a Colorado Tesla dealership, which included Molotov cocktails being thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” spray painted on the building.
Saturday's demonstration in Boston had a festive atmosphere, with a brass band playing music as protesters carried signs and chanted. Several of the signs mocked Musk and DOGE, with one reading: “Stop Elon and his despicable Muskrats.”
“This government led by Trump and Musk, it’s gone completely off the rails and we are here to stop that,” said Carina Campovasso, a retired federal worker. “And I hope they listen.”
About 300 demonstrators protested at a Tesla dealership in New York City on Saturday. Police said nine people were taken into custody but did not elaborate on the charges they faced.
Tesla's share price has fallen by nearly a third since Trump took office, though it's still higher than it was a year ago. Musk’s current net worth is an estimated $359 billion, according to Forbes, which calculated his 2024 net worth as $195 billion.

(Reuters) -     Electric vehicle maker Polestar has secured a 12-month loan facility of up to $450 million, it said on Friday, and would delay its fourth-quarter results in April along with its annual filing for fiscal 2024.
Backed by China's Geely, the company has struggled to drum up demand for its vehicles amid a softer buying environment and strong competition from carmakers such as Tesla.

TSLA

On December 2, 2024 a Delaware judge upheld her prior January 2024 ruling that Elon Musk's compensation package, valued at $55.8 billion, had to be rescinded because it was approved in breach of the directors' fiduciary duties (Tornetta v Musk). One month later, the same Delaware judge approved a settlement wherein Tesla's directors agreed to return or forgo $919 million in compensation, which had been subject to a separate legal complaint by the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit (Police & Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit v Musk). The two cases were brought as derivative actions on behalf of shareholders of Tesla. The former action is now subject to an appeal brought by Tesla, but also an appeal by a separate group of Florida shareholders.
Aside from their important impacts on corporate governance, and the fiduciary duties of directors, the two cases are also notable for setting Delaware records for legal fee awards, with Tornetta resulting in a legal fee award of $345 million, the largest such fee approval by a Delaware Court; and Police & Fire resulting in a $167 million fee award, the fourth largest in the history of shareholder litigation in Delaware.
Discussion
In America, and unlike in Canada, the default rule is that litigants pay for their own legal expenses. However, an important exception to this ""American Rule"" is for shareholder litigation that succeeds in Court, and in so doing secures a benefit common to all shareholders. This ""common fund"" doctrine presumes that the winning party is then entitled to have their legal fees paid out of the common benefit they have created.
Delaware case law, and in particular Sugarland Industries Inc v Thomas from 1980, has developed factors to award such fees primarily on the result achieved, rather than the traditional measure of billed hours. The use of ""value billing"" allows Courts to assess the fee holistically, and to provide incentives for counsel to take on challenging cases at the risk of recovering nothing at the end. This was a particularly important factor in Tornetta where the plaintiff ""faced some of the best law firms in the country, who put plaintiff through their paces."" The action took six years to pursue, involved an extensive trial record, and was done entirely on contingency, creating a ""massive contingency risk"" for the plaintiff's counsel.
In Tornetta, the plaintiff's counsel initially sought a staggering $5.6 billion legal fee, based on the maximum value that could be saved from the rescission of Mr. Musk's compensation. The Court described that as an unjustifiable windfall, and instead valued Mr. Musk's compensation based on its fair value at the grant date, which was $2.3 billion, and applied a ""conservative"" 15% fee resulting in $345 million.
Could shareholders of a Canadian company pursue a similar funding strategy to litigate director or officer breaches of fiduciary duty, or other wrongs to the corporation? While there have been no strict equivalents to the Tesla case to date, it would seem at least theoretically possible.
All Canadian jurisdictions already employ a ""loser pays"" model whereby a successful party to litigation is presumed to be owed legal costs, though there are provincial variances as to how those costs are calculated. But common to all Canadian jurisdictions is a presumption that, absent extraordinary circumstances, the indemnification to the successful party will only be partial (in Ontario, 60% is often cited as the normal rule). The shifting cost rules of each province are therefore unable to provide the type of litigation incentives present in the Tesla cases.
An alternative route may be reliance on the corporate statutes, which provide the mechanisms by which Canadian derivative actions may be pursued, and which also confer broad judicial discretion to make orders including for the payment of ""reasonable legal fees"" (see Canada Business Corporations Act, section 240(d) and Business Corporations Act (Ontario), section 247(d)). Through those provisions, parties have been able to seek advances for legal costs, though there has been marked reticence to providing them on a full indemnification basis. A key concern of the Court is that a blanket indemnity could facilitate counsel to pursue risk-free litigation regardless of its underlying merits.
It does not appear that anyone has yet attempted to use the Canadian corporate statutes to seek approval of a contingency fee agreement. A contingent arrangement avoids the risk of encouraging risk-free litigation, as litigants' counsel still bear significant risk, but they do so with the prospect of having that risk rewarded with enhanced compensation. It therefore seems to be an open question as to whether those statutory provisions could be used as such.
In Canada, a more familiar way to pursue contingency fee funding for a claim on behalf of many claimants is the Class Proceedings Act, which provides well established mechanisms for seeking approval of contingency fees as well as litigation funding agreements. That leads to the question of whether a derivative action can be pursued in tandem as a class action. There has been some commentary which casts doubt on this, but there is at least one authority that supports the possibility. In Peppiatt v Nicol, a class action was brought by equity members of a golf club non-profit corporation. The claim asserted both personal claims by the class members, but also derivative claims of the club against a bank. The Court allowed the class and derivative claims to be joined together, which ultimately succeeded against the bank. While the counsel's fee arrangement was approved by the Court under the Class Proceedings Act, there are no reports as to what the specific arrangement was.
Contingent fee agreements may be available for the pursuit of derivative actions for the benefit of shareholders, without shareholders having to personally fund them, but there would still seem to be one important restriction: there must be a monetary recovery.
Cases such as Police and Fire Retirement System, where the claim seeks a partial repayment of funds, may be viable, but cases like Tornetta, where the benefit to the corporation is only to be restrained from issuing cheap equity, may not. In the latter type of case, the shareholders may benefit through the increased value of their shares, but there is no obvious source of money to fund legal fees, and no mechanism equivalent to the one in Delaware to allow a Court to fashion a fee award directly payable by the company, other than the usual payment of partial indemnity costs. The shareholders in such cases may be in the classic situation of a collective action problem, where collectively they have a significant interest in the pursuit of such cases, but there are no individual incentives or other mechanisms to foster their pursuit.

Authorities in Colorado have arrested a 40-year-old woman accused of repeatedly vandalizing a Tesla dealership in Loveland.
According to a statement from the police department in Loveland, a city of about 79,000 people located about 50 miles north of Denver, Lucy Grace Nelson was arrested just before midnight Monday.
Police apprehended her while she was in possession of incendiary devices and other materials commonly used in vandalism crimes, the Loveland POlice Department said.
""Detectives apprehended Nelson prior to further damage occurring,"" the statement said.
She has been charged with using explosives or incendiary devices during a felony, criminal mischief involving damages between $2,000 and $5,000 and criminal attempt to commit a Class 3 felony.
According to police, Nelson's arrest follows an investigation opened Jan. 29 into vandalism at the dealership.
On Feb. 7, police said in a statement that the dealership had been vandalized the night prior during an attempted arson attack.
""Various vehicles and the Tesla building were vandalized with graffiti, some of which were offensive and hateful in nature,"" it said.
A $100,000 cash surety bond has been issued for Nelson.
The incident comes as Tesla has become a target for public anger since its chief executive officer, Elon Musk, has joined the Trump administration. Tasked with cutting wasteful spending from the federal government, Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency has sought to cancel billions in programs and fire thousands of federal employees, which has attracted growing criticism and several lawsuits.
Among the incidents include Tesla chargers being vandalized with Nazi swastikas, as Musk has been accused of giving a Nazi salute during President Donald Trump's inauguration. The world's richest man has denied the accusation.
Tesla responded to one such incident stating it would remove the graffiti the following day.
""We will press charges for vandalism at Superchargers,"" Tesla Charging said on X, which Musk also owns.

DENVER (AP) — A woman is suspected in a string of vandalism against a Colorado Tesla dealership that included Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles, the words “Nazi cars” spray painted on the building and a message that appeared to be directed against Tesla founder Elon Musk, according to court documents.
Lucy Grace Nelson was arrested Monday in Loveland after police said she returned to the dealership there with “additional incendiary devices” and materials used in vandalism. Police are still investigating her alleged motive, department spokesperson Chris Padgett said.
The case comes amid rising concerns voiced by Democrats and some Republicans about Musk’s influence over the administration of President Donald Trump and follows recent protests at Tesla storerooms elsewhere in the U.S.
Nelson was arrested on state charges of using an incendiary device or explosives during a felony, criminal mischief and criminal attempt to commit a felony in connection with the vandalism Monday, police said. However, police said they are working with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and federal charges were likely.
Nelson, who posted bond and was released from jail Tuesday, did not immediately respond to a telephone message on Wednesday.
The arrest affidavit outlining police's evidence against Nelson suggests there could be a second person involved, noting that the person seen on surveillance video during one of the six incidents since Jan. 29 seemed to have a smaller build than Nelson. But it identified Nelson as the person seen at other times.
Padgett said police were investigating the possibility of someone else being involved. He declined to release more details about the case because of the federal investigation.
In one of the incidents, someone spray painted an obscenity believed to be directed at Musk before being chased away by a security guard, the affidavit notes.
Security footage from the dealer also showed someone throwing Molotov cocktails into a row of Tesla sedans. The affidavit said at least four vehicles worth a combined $220,000 were targeted by the incendiary devices, which were crafted from empty liquor bottles. Police said that when Nelson was arrested, in her car they observed cans of spray paint, gasoline, bottles and various cloth pieces that could be soaked with an accelerant.
A woman who answered the phone at the Tesla dealership in Loveland declined to comment. Tesla did not return an email seeking comment.

It looks like Tesla users are turning away from its CEO Elon Musk. In January, only about half the number of Tesla's sold last year in Europe, and those disappointing sales are depressing the share price.
Tesla's share price fell so far on Tuesday that its market capitalization fell below the one trillion dollar mark again. The share price has now fallen more than 8 percent to just over $302, leaving all of the group's shares still worth a total of $973 billion.
Earlier, the Association of European Automobile Manufacturers (ACEA) announced that 34 percent more battery-electric cars were sold on the continent in January than a year earlier. During the same period, however, Tesla sales fell 45 percent.
With the share price collapse, Tesla has now lost all of its gains since Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election.
Since then, Musk has not only been responsible for massive layoffs in the U.S. federal government, but has also caused disgust with an alleged Hitler salute and his part in the election campaign of the far-right AfD.
Despite losses in recent weeks, the auto group is still worth more than General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, Hyundai and BMW combined.

Shares of industrial and transportation companies recouped some of their recent losses, as traders hedged their bets on the outlook for economic growth and inflation.
Tesla shares fell sharply after the electric vehicle maker warned that its European sales plunged 45%, reflecting consumer distaste for Chief Executive Elon Musk's insertion of himself into local politics. There are some fears that the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by Musk, could trigger a slowdown in economic activity due to ham-fisted cuts and confusion.
""The U.S. economy might slow because of the DOGE and uncertainty on tariffs,"" said Lorenzo Di Mattia, manager of hedge fund Sibilla Global Fund.
The Fifth District Survey of Manufacturing Activity's index for February rose to 6 from minus-4 in January, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said.
Shares of Chinese car maker Li Auto rallied after it launched its first all-electric SUV -- the Li i8 -- in a social media post late Monday.
Kitchen-equipment maker Middleby is spinning off its food-processing business and refreshing its board with new directors in a bid to unlock value. The changes come after the company faced pressure from an activist investor.
Airline ANA Holdings plans to buy more than $14 billion of jets from Boeing, Airbus and Embraer, partly to meet rising travel demand to Japan.

Shares of Tesla slipped after the company's sales fell 45% in Europe last month, and the company said it would buy certain assets from a struggling German automation-systems supplier.
Tesla's stock was trading 8.8% lower, at $301.60, ahead of Tuesday's closing bell. Despite having fallen 25% since the beginning of the year, shares are up 51% in the past 52 weeks.
The electric-vehicle maker sold 9,945 cars in January across the European Union and the U.K., down from 18,161 vehicles in the same month last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
The Austin, Texas, company's market share fell to 1% from 1.8%, the trade group said.
Also on Tuesday, Manz--which filed for insolvency late last year amid a liquidity squeeze--said Tesla Automation would take over its Reutlingen manufacturing site, as well as more than 300 employees that work there and movable tangible assets. Around 100 employees at the site would lose their jobs, Manz added.
Financial terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.

Copyright © BusinessAMBE 2023
Open Vld seems to be divided over Elon Musk. This became clear once again last weekend. Chairwoman Eva De Bleeker first expressed her support for an Elon Musk initiative, but later withdrew it. Party colleague Maurits Vande Reyde, however, still appears to be a fan of the boss of SpaceX, Tesla and X.
Key Takeaways
Elon Musk has in recent years become not only the richest man in the world, but also one of the most controversial. The latter has certainly not diminished since he threw his support behind Donald Trump. Thanks to that support, he came to head the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This is a government agency whose job is to ensure that the U.S. government makes significant savings. Musk takes a very drastic approach to this, something that has already brought him much criticism. Yet there are also many loyal supporters.
Last weekend, Musk again came into the spotlight with a striking new initiative from DOGE. Indeed, all government employees received an e-mail on Friday telling them to briefly send in five bullet points Monday morning what they had done at work over the past week. Those who did not send that e-mail would be fired. In this way, Musk says he wants to find out which government employees don't even bother to check their emails.
Deleted mail from The Bleeker
Although Elon Musk's plan quickly drew widespread criticism in the U.S., Open Vld Chairwoman Eva De Bleeker was quick to show herself in favor. She called the plan on X ""just common sense, regardless of what people are all planning in the United States."" De Bleeker also pointed out that such reporting is very common in the private sector.
That indirect support for Musk was soon widely criticized, after which the chairwoman removed her post. ""The message was: we should strive for a much more efficient government,"" she writes in a new post. Bleeker adds ""for the record"" that she is not a fan of Musk. ""On the contrary,"" it sounds.
Contention within Open Vld
So Eva De Bleeker is not a fan of Elon Musk, but on the dark blue flank of the Flemish liberals there are some big fans. These include Vincent Van Quickenborne and Flemish MP Maurits Vande Reyde.
""I have been following the man since when no one knew him. He is not only a successful entrepreneur, but also a visionary. And is he really that extreme? Is it extreme to ask officials what they have done? Is it extreme to say that government should confine itself to core tasks? I think we need our own Musk in Flanders,"" says Vande Reyde in Het Nieuwsblad.
Gwendolyn Rutten, on the other hand, is anything but a fan. She even calls Musk ""a dangerous madman"" and adds that, in her opinion, he is not liberal.
Foundation Congress
These divergent opinions prove once again the divisions within Open Vld. It promises to be an exciting few months for the party leading up to its founding congress in September. There the party will receive a new name and the liberal party will make a new start. On which line that will be, however, is not at all clear yet.

By Dominic Chopping
Tesla will buy certain assets from Manz, after the struggling German automation systems supplier entered into insolvency proceedings.
Tesla Automation, which specializes in constructing special-purpose machines at three German locations, will take over Manz's Reutlingen site as well as more than 300 employees that work at the site and movable tangible assets, Manz said Tuesday. Around 100 employees at Reutlingen will lose their jobs.
Tesla Automation is a subsidiary of U.S. electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla.
Manz filed for insolvency late last year amid a liquidity squeeze. Its battery cell production technology business had struggled with a deteriorating European battery cell market that faced continued weakness.
Completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of the German Federal Cartel Office.
Financial details weren't disclosed.

By Jiahui Huang
Tesla rolled out an update to its driving-assistance software in China, a move that could signal final regulatory approval is forthcoming, as the technology becomes increasingly common in the world's largest EV market.
The U.S. carmaker said in its mini-application hosted by the WeChat platform Tuesday that it has pushed out a software update for some users that includes features such as its autopilot driving assistance for city roads, an in-car camera and an updated map.
The updated driving-assistance feature can guide cars to exit ramps and intersections and recognize traffic lights for turns. The update includes automatic lane changing and can find the best routes to use when drivers don't set a particular route.
With the new update, an in-car camera can monitor if the driver is paying attention, though the video feed will be processed within the car and won't be accessible to any parties, including Tesla, according to the post.
Tesla didn't explicitly characterize the update as equivalent to full self-driving, but analysts said the functions are quite similar.
The release of the update to a select group of customers provides an early testing ground for Tesla's advanced driver-assistance system in the China market, said Nomura analyst Joel Ying.
Tesla's FSD offering is a market leader in the field, but hasn't been approved by Chinese authorities yet. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk visited Beijing last April to meet with Chinese officials, including Premier Li Qiang, about launching FSD functions in China.
Analysts expect approval for Tesla's FSD offering in China this year, as competition heats up in artificial intelligence-powered driving technology in the country following BYD's introduction earlier this month of a new system for mass-market models.
""It will take some time for Tesla to make sure its FSD is fully adapted to China market scenarios, as it could be totally different situations, especially in Tier-1 cities with large populations,"" Ying said.
For now, the update is only available for some car owners that purchased Tesla's ADAS functions with a price tag of 64,000 yuan, equivalent to around $8,800.
Musk said last month that Tesla was facing some challenges on getting approval for its own driving tech in China because Chinese authorities didn't allow Tesla to transfer video outside of the country to train its models, while U.S. authorities didn't let the carmaker train the FSD system in China. Musk also said he expects Tesla to offer unsupervised FSD in ""almost every market this year.""
When Tesla finally launches FSD in China, that should further drive popularization of AI-powered driving technology in the Chinese market, Ying said.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -     Tesla plans to update software in cars in China to add driving-assistance capabilities that will help drivers navigate city streets, according to a company notification and two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The U.S. automaker on Monday notified Chinese users of its software of the planned update to its autopilot feature but retracted the notice within minutes, showed multiple posts on Chinese social media.
The notice was authentic but sent prematurely, the two people told Reuters.
The update will give the software a less advanced version of the Full Self-Driving feature available in the United States due to insufficient data training on Chinese roads and traffic rules, one of the people said.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The software update was first reported by Bloomberg.

* Judge issues restraining order at labor unions' request

* Agencies likely violated Privacy Act of 1974, judge says

* DOGE faces multiple lawsuits from Democratic states, legal
groups

Feb 24 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday blocked the
government downsizing team created by President Donald Trump and
spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk from accessing sensitive
data maintained by the U.S. Education Department and the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management.
U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman in Greenbelt, Maryland
issued the temporary restraining order at the behest of a
coalition of labor unions who argued the agencies wrongly
granted Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency access to
records containing personal information on millions of
Americans.
The judge said the plaintiffs had established that both
agencies had likely violated federal law by granting DOGE
""sweeping access"" to sensitive personal information in violation
of the Privacy Act of 1974.
That information included Social Security numbers, dates of
birth, home addresses, income and assets, citizenship status and
disability status for current and former federal employees and
student aid recipients.
The Trump administration had argued that a ruling blocking
DOGE from accessing the information would impede the Republican
president's ability to fulfill his agenda by limiting what
information his advisors can access.
But Boardman, an appointee of Trump's Democratic
predecessor Joe Biden, said her order prevents the disclosure of
the plaintiffs’ sensitive personal information to DOGE
affiliates who, on the current record, do not have a need to
know the information to perform their duties.""
The White House did not immediately respond to a request
for comment.
DOGE has
swept through
federal agencies since the Republican president returned to
office last month and put the chief executive of carmaker Tesla
in charge of rooting out wasteful spending as part of
Trump's dramatic
overhaul of government,
which has included
thousands of job cuts
.
Several lawsuits have been filed by Democratic-led U.S.
states and liberal-leaning legal groups seeking to prevent DOGE
from accessing government systems.
On Friday, a federal judge in New York at the request of 19
Democratic state attorneys general
extended an order
blocking DOGE from accessing Treasury Department systems
responsible for trillions of dollars in government payments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration laid off 4% of its staff as part of a government-wide trimming of probationary employees, a spokesperson said Monday.
The agency has pending investigations into Tesla, which is headed by Elon Musk, the CEO of the automaker and President Donald Trump's senior adviser leading efforts to shrink the government.
NHTSA said under President Joe Biden the agency grew by 30% and is still considerably larger after the job cuts earlier this month. Its workforce was about 800 before the job cuts.

TSLA

Proposed amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) introduce safe harbors for liability from transactions involving directors, officers and controlling stockholders and define and limit a stockholder's right to inspect corporate books and records.
Long considered a business-friendly state because of its corporate tax advantages and, more importantly, the Court of Chancery - a unique court of equity composed of sophisticated jurists responsible for case law that has shaped how Delaware corporations operate - Delaware has come under fire in recent years for being “too favorable” to minority stockholders. This has led several corporations with large controlling stockholders, including Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink (all controlled by Elon Musk), to reincorporate out of Delaware, and several others, including Meta, Dropbox and Pershing Square Capital Management, to announce plans to leave Delaware. The proposed amendments to the DGCL attempt to stem the tide by making it more difficult for minority stockholders to prove that a transaction in which a director, officer or controlling stockholder has a financial interest was not entirely fair to a corporation and by limiting corporate books and records a minority stockholder may inspect.
Background
On February 17, 2025, Senate Bill 21 was introduced in the Delaware General Assembly, proposing significant amendments to Section 144 of the DGCL with respect to interested directors and officers and controlling stockholder transactions, and to Section 220 of the DGCL with respect to inspection of books and records by stockholders.
Senate Bill 21 is unusual because of the ostensible enhanced protection for corporate directors, officers and controlling stockholders the amendments would provide, and because of the manner in which the bill was introduced.
Historically, amendments to the DGCL have been formulated by the Corporation Law Council of the Corporation Law Section of the Delaware State Bar Association and recommended to the Delaware General Assembly after approval by the Delaware State Bar Association. The amendments proposed in Senate Bill 21, in contrast, were introduced by a bipartisan group of lawmakers without following the traditional process and with drafting assistance from the Delaware law firm that represents Tesla and Elon Musk.
Continue reading for a more detailed summary of the proposed amendments.
Proposed Amendments to Section 144
The first section of Senate Bill 21 proposes a number of safe harbors for liability arising from acts or transactions involving directors, officers and controlling stockholders.
The proposed amendments to Section 144(a) provide a safe harbor for liability arising from any act or transaction involving or between a corporation and a director or officer of the corporation, or any organization in which a director or officer of the corporation has a financial interest, if the act or transaction is:
The proposed amendments to Section 144(b) provide a safe harbor for liability arising from any controlling stockholder transaction (other than a going private transaction), if the transaction is:
New proposed Section 144(c) provides a safe harbor for liability arising from any controlling stockholder transaction constituting a going private transaction, if the transaction is:
New proposed Section 144(d) provides several parameters to the safe harbors, including:
New proposed Section 144(e) defines several key terms used in the safe harbors.
Proposed Amendments to Section 220
The second section of Senate Bill 21 proposes several changes to inspection of books and records of a Delaware corporation.
The proposed amendments to Section 220(a) define “books and records” (previously undefined), which a stockholder may inspect in accordance with that Section, to include:
The proposed amendments to Section 220 additionally limit a stockholder's right to inspect and copy the corporation's books and records to situations where only all three of the following are true:
Further, under the proposed amendments to Section 220, the corporation may impose reasonable restrictions on the confidentiality, use, or distribution of books and records and it may redact portions of the books and records not specifically related to the stockholder's purpose. The corporation may also condition production of books and records on the demanding stockholder's agreement that any information in the corporation's books and records be deemed incorporated by reference in any complaint filed in relation to the subject matter referenced in the demand for inspection.
What This May Mean for You
Directors, officers and controlling stockholders of Delaware corporations should be aware that the proposed amendments, if enacted into law, may change legal practice with respect to initiating, negotiating or approving a transaction in which a director, officer or controlling stockholder has a financial interest. In order to obtain the benefit of the proposed safe harbors from liability, these parties should follow the processes outlined and obtain advice of counsel.
Legal news and commentary on Senate Bill 21 indicate that it is a significant data point in a larger conversation about the balance of power between corporate insiders and minority stockholders and Delaware's continued primacy as the preferred jurisdiction for incorporation. Expect further news and updates after Senate Bill 21 is first heard at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing planned for March 12.

TSLA


OXON HILL, Md. (AP) — At an annual gathering of conservative activists, the signature red “ Make America Great Again ” hats popularized by President Donald Trump were interspersed with a noticeable number of the black “Dark MAGA” hats made popular by Elon Musk.
It was just one sign of Musk's emerging influence and how the world's wealthiest man — who once backed DemocratsBarack Obama and Joe Biden — has become a conservative power center in his own right due to his connections to Trump.
“He is an authentic and unique individual. I am glad he is on the team,” said Whitney Mason, a 62-year-old real estate agent who was traveling from Seattle.
Musk was an unexpected guest of honor at the Conservative Political Action Conference, with his appearance announced hours before he took the stage wielding a chainsaw. The prop, and his comments, left little subtlety about his role or his influence, days after the Trump administration claimed in court that Musk was not in charge of his signature Department of Government Efficiency.
Speakers at CPAC frequently brought up DOGE, playfully named after a meme coin with the face of a Shiba Inu dog popularized by Musk in 2021. They variously referred to him as a “white knight,” a “hero of free speech,” and according to one of his harshest critics, Steve Bannon, “Superman.”
“What Elon and the team are doing is what Congress has not had the ability to do,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson told the crowd of conservatives. ""They have cracked the code they’re inside the belly of the beast of the bureaucracy, and the algorithms are crawling through.""
The Trump administration, under Musk’s advice, has fired thousands of federal workers without warning. It gave employees an option to resign and gutted agencies without congressional approval. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who bought Twitter in 2022, has pledged to identify areas to cut costs and streamline services and save trillions of taxpayer dollars, with directives that spark confusion and have prompted demonstrations across agencies.
As Trump spoke at CPAC on Saturday, Musk announced federal workers would get an email to explain what they accomplished over the last week, saying “failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”
“Elon is doing a great job,” Trump said in his speech on Saturday. “We love Elon, don’t we? He’s a character.”
Critics have said that Musk could stand to benefit from his close relationship with Trump as there are a number of federal investigations and safety programs created through federal agency orders that are hitting Tesla's plans to create fleets of robo-taxis and self-driving cars. Musk's SpaceX also has major contracts with the Pentagon, NASA and intelligence agencies.
Colin McEvers, a 19-year old who voted for Trump, admires Vice President JD Vance and praised Musk’s business acumen, said he was concerned about Musk's growing power in the federal government and the decline of regulations that were protecting workers from big corporations.
“I like the basic principle of making government more efficient and cutting back on costs,” said McEvers, a political science student at Salisbury University. “Do I think that there could be a lot of self-interest involved with him, with the richest man in the world playing a very large role in government in reducing these regulations, which could very well end up profiting his businesses? I definitely think that’s probably a very large part of it too.”
The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk’s other companies.
Musk’s positions on issues like H-1B visas for high-skilled immigrant workers have made him a target of popular MAGA figures such as Bannon, who once served as Trump’s chief strategist and hosts the influential “War Room” podcast. Musk was born in South Africa and was once on an H-1B visa.
Bannon has previously cast the world’s richest man as a “parasitic illegal immigrant” and an “oligarch,” who will abandon Trump when he deems him no longer useful. Bannon didn't criticize Musk at CPAC and instead faced scrutiny for making a straight-arm gesture on stage that critics on the right and left compared to a Nazi-style salute. Bannon said he was giving the crowd a wave.
A few miles away, at a Washington hotel near the White House, more than a thousand anti-Trump activists and thought leaders gathered at the Principles First Summit and laughed repeatedly as another billionaire, Mark Cuban, charged that Trump was “overselling” and Musk's actions so far were not helping people who voted for the Republican president.
“Elon is going to make his job a thousand times harder,"" Cuban said using expletives to accuse Musk of not caring.
Trump on Saturday posted on Truth Social that he “WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE."" During his speech, Trump trivialized complaints that Musk does not have an official role in his government despite his strong influence on decisions during his first month in office.
“People said ‘well, what official position does he have?’ I say patriot,” Trump said.

Key takeaways
A Japanese consortium wants Tesla to invest in Nissan after the failure of merger talks between Nissan and Honda. The plan involves former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Hiro Mizuno, a former Tesla board member.
The group hopes that Tesla, led by Elon Musk, will become a strategic investor in Nissan. This would allow Tesla to use Nissan's underused US factories for more domestic production amid concerns about US import duties.
Financial support
Moody's downgraded Nissan's credit rating earlier this week because of low profitability due to weak demand for their current model line. The company announced a significant workforce reduction last year after a dramatic 93 percent drop in net profit in the first half of the year and expects an annual loss of more than $500 million.
This proposed investment comes after Nissan's rejection of Honda's $58 billion merger bid, which fueled concerns about possible acquisitions by foreign investors. This includes Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn, which tried to acquire a majority stake in Nissan last December. It then tried to get Renault to sell its 35 percent stake in the company, but these attempts were abandoned before merger talks with Honda were announced.
Manufacturing and expansion
Experts believe Tesla's involvement could reduce the risk of foreign takeovers while expanding Tesla's manufacturing presence in the United States. Nissan's plants in the U.S. have a combined capacity to produce 1 million vehicles annually, but currently produce only about 525,000 units per year.
It is important to note that neither Tesla, Musk, Nissan or others directly involved have officially confirmed this development.

NASA awarded a contract to Elon Musk's SpaceX to provide launch services for the agency's near-Earth object surveyor mission.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Friday said the launch service will cost around $100 million.
The mission, aimed at detecting and observing asteroids and comets that could pose an impact threat to Earth, is targeted to launch no earlier than September 2027 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Florida.
The mission will conduct a five-year baseline survey to detect at least two-thirds of unknown near-Earth objects larger than 140 meters. Those could cause significant damage if they were to impact Earth, NASA said.

Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's Trump Media & Technology Group
said on Friday it will propose reincorporating the company in Florida at its annual meeting in
late April.
""We look forward to uniting our legal home with our physical home as we explore
possibilities for mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, and other growth,"" said CEO Devin Nunes.
Nunes added that the company is committed to Florida, which ""shows tremendous respect for
free enterprise.""
The proposal comes as several companies, including Dropbox and Bill Ackman's
management company, have recently said they were moving or considering moving their
incorporation out of Delaware.
The Wall Street Journal reported in late January that social media giant Meta Platforms
is in discussions about moving its incorporation from Delaware to Texas or other
states.
Elon Musk's Tesla and SpaceX moved their state of incorporation to Texas from
Delaware after a Chancery judge last year ordered Musk's $56 billion pay package from Tesla to
be rescinded.
For Trump Media, a Delaware judge had ruled in September that the company breached an
agreement with Orlando's ARC Global and the fund must receive more than half a million
additional shares before a lock-up on insider sales expires.

More than 375,000 Tesla vehicles are being recalled because of issues with their power steering systems, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a notice issued Friday.
The recall applies to Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles with software dating from before 2023, according to the NHTSA.
The company has announced a software fix for affected vehicles.
The NHTSA recall notice alerts drivers to the possibility of vehicles' power steering electronic circuit board becoming overstressed. That stress could cause a loss of power steering during stops and starts.
That power loss could increase the risk of a crash, with drivers needing to exert more force to maintain steering control.
This marks the 15th NHTSA recall of the 2023 Model Y, mostly related to software.
The NHTSA opened an Engineering Analysis into the issue earlier in the month.
Owners of affected vehicles will receive a letter in the mail informing them of the recall.
Last month, an unrelated software problem forced Tesla to issue a recall of more than 239,000 of its Model 3, S, X and Y vehicles. That problem related to a possible disabling of the vehicles' rearview cameras.
Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported the branch of the NHTSA overseeing autonomous vehicles was facing cuts brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, which is headed by Elon Musk.

Former Tesla board member Hiromichi Mizuno denied a Financial Times report that says he leads a Japanese group seeking an investment in Nissan Motor from Elon Musk's carmaker.
""I have absolutely no involvement in what is reported in this article and am unaware of any such moves by the Japanese government,"" Mizuno said in a post on X.
Mizuno added that while he isn't with Tesla anymore, he doubts Tesla has any interest in acquiring Nissan's U.S. factories.
The Financial Times report said Mizuno led a group, including ex-premier Yoshihide Suga and his former aide Hiroto Izumi, that planned to court Tesla for an investment in Nissan and believed Tesla was interested in Nissan's U.S. plants.

Tesla is recalling more than 375,000 vehicles due to a power steering issue.
The recall is for certain 2023 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles operating software prior to 2023.38.4, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The printed circuit board for the electronic power steering assist may become overstressed, causing a loss of power steering assist when the vehicle reaches a stop and then accelerates again, the agency said.
The loss of power could required more effort to control the car by drivers, particularly at low speeds, increasing the risk of a crash.
Tesla isn't aware of any crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the condition.
The electric vehicle maker headed by Elon Musk has released a free software update to address the issue.
Letters are expected to be sent to vehicle owners on March 25.
Owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752 or the NHTSA at 1-888-327-4236.

(Alliance News) - Italy's competition watchdog said Friday it has launched an investigation into four electric vehicle manufacturers, including Tesla Inc and Stellantis NV, for alleged unfair trade practices.

The four separate investigations target BYD Industria Italia, Stellantis Europe, Tesla Italy, and Volkswagen Group Italia, all Italian or European subsidiaries of the multinational automakers.

The investigations concern information provided to consumers about driving range, battery degradation and limitations on battery warranties, all ""potentially in violation"" of Italian consumer protection laws,"" the Competition Authority wrote in a note.

""Companies' websites appear to have displayed generic, sometimes contradictory information about the driving range of their marketed electric vehicles, without clarifying what factors affect the advertised maximum range and to what extent they affect the actual range,"" the regulator said.

The websites also do not provide ""clear and complete information"" on how the battery capacity of their electric vehicles may degrade due to normal vehicle use and the limitations of the warranties offered.

The regulator said it conducted an inspection at all four companies Thursday, along with the Finance Guard.

The lifespan of electric vehicle batteries depends on multiple factors. Degradation, which reduces energy capacity, can occur due to extremely cold weather conditions and uneven charging.

Tesla shares fell 0.5 percent in pre-market trading to USD352.76 each Friday in New York while Stellantis rose 1.8 percent to EUR13.57 per share in Milan.

During the biggest night in music, the 2025 Grammy awards ceremony, Kanye's wife, Bianca Censori, caused quite a commotion by walking the red carpet when she removed her coat to reveal . . . just about everything. Her dress, if you can call it that, was completely sheer. And after I uttered, ""Well, that's a . . . choice,"" I started thinking about the legalities associated with employee dress codes (as one does).

Dress Codes Generally
How your employees dress should reflect your company culture. Whether you have a dress-up or dress-down culture, employers should clearly define dress code expectations and communicate them to employees. Your guidelines should be relatively simple. Provide clear examples of what is and what is not acceptable in your workplace (jeans and polo shirts - in; see through dresses that leave nothing to the imagination - out). Employers should use gender neutral language in describing appropriate attire (long gone are the days of requiring women to wear panty hose and skirts). Also consider the diversity of your workforce and the possibility that some employees may prefer to wear their own cultural attire in the workplace.
If any of your employees work remotely or if you use videoconferencing in your business, you should also review your policies to determine if they even address how your employees should be presenting themselves when they are ""on camera"" either doing business in-house or with customers, vendors, etc. Make it clear what is acceptable and what is not while the employee is ""on camera"" representing the company.
Accommodations and Dress Codes
Under Title VII, employers are required to reasonably accommodate employees with disabilities and employees who have closely held religious beliefs. ThoseThese accommodations may include modifications to the employer's dress code for that employee. Employers should engage in the interactive process with any employee who requests a modification to the company's dress code. Remember, under Title VII, employers must now accommodate an employee's closely held religious belief unless the accommodation would cause the employer undue hardship.
The NLRA and Dress Codes
In 2022, the NLRB issued Tesla, Inc., 370 NLRB No. 131 (2022), which held that workplace uniform rules limiting employees' ability to wear union apparel or insignia are unlawful absent a showing of ""special circumstances."" In the Tesla opinion, the Board gave examples of special circumstances which included, ""when their display may jeopardize employee safety, damage machinery or products, exacerbate employee dissension, or unreasonably interfere with a public image that the employer has established, or when necessary to maintain decorum and discipline among employees."" But these exceptions have rarely been recognized outside of the healthcarehealthcare or retail settings. Keep in mind, however, that the definition of ""special circumstances"" will likely broaden under the second Trump administration.
The FLSA and Uniforms
Not all dress codes require uniforms but if you require hourly employees to wear certain attire, particularly if the attire is branded or otherwise recognized as part of your brand, you need to be sure you comply with the FLSA. If an employer requires an employee to wear a uniform, the cost and maintenance of that uniform is considered a business expense of the employer under the FLSA. This means that if the employee is required by the employer to bear the cost, it may not reduce the employee below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. For example, if an employer pays an employee $8 per hour and the employee works 20 hours per week, an employer cannot legally deduct more than $15 ($0.75 x 20) for the cost of the uniform for that work week. (Remember, many states have rules regarding how to legally deduct from employee paychecks as well). Further, the cost of maintaining the uniform may have to be borne by the employer if the uniform is something other than ""wash and wear"" which the employee can launder with their own clothing. The DOL has some useful guidance regarding uniforms and the FLSA here: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-L36-PURL-gpo24664/pdf/GOVPUB-L36-PURL-gpo24664.pdf
Clothing and Hate speech
And speaking of Kanye . . . Recently Kanye West made headlines when he marketed and sold a swastika t-shirt. Remember, hate speech is never protected speech, and should be banned in your workplace. Any employee who uses their work attire to engage in hate speech should be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

(Reuters) -     Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency has cut three out of roughly seven people in a U.S. auto safety agency unit overseeing the safety of autonomous vehicles, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.
The workers fired by the agency headed by the Tesla CEO said they do not believe they were targeted because they are examining driverless cars, the newspaper reported.
The autonomous vehicles safety unit cuts are part of reductions at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is losing about 10% of its workforce through firings and buyout offers, according to the Washington Post.

Feb 20 (Reuters) - Rivian forecast modest gross
profit this year, after reporting its first-ever positive
earnings margin in the fourth quarter, as factory upgrades and
supplier renegotiations improved efficiency at the EV maker.
Shares of the Irvine, California-based EV maker were up
about 4% in extended trading.
However, Rivian projected an unexpected drop in deliveries
for the year as an uncertain economy and shifting consumer
preferences temper demand for its more expensive electric pickup
trucks and SUVs.
Its gross profit stood at $170 million in the fourth
quarter, compared with a loss of $606 million a year earlier.
The company also expects higher costs from U.S. President
Donald Trump's plans to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada.
""We have a supply chain that does have a footprint in both
Mexico and Canada, and so large tariffs being applied will just
translate to higher costs for us,"" CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters.
""There is such a high level of uncertainty that will
ultimately impact consumer behavior and top-line revenue,"" he
added.
Rivian forecast annual deliveries of between 46,000 and
51,000 vehicles, lower than Wall Street expectations of 55,520,
according to 15 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Last year, it
delivered 51,579 units.
The EV maker is also planning to halt production for more
than a month in the second half of 2025 to upgrade its assembly
lines, as it gears up to launch the Tesla Model Y-rivaling R2
vehicle and start its deliveries early next year.
EV makers are staring at a tough market, with Elon Musk-led
market leader Tesla reporting its first drop in annual sales in
2024.
Electric big rig manufacturer Nikola recently filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and said it would pursue a
sale of its assets after struggling with rapid cash burn and
funding challenges amid weak demand.
Rivian, too, continues to burn billions of dollars in cash
every year. However, the rate at which it expends cash is
expected to slow as profitability improves along with its sales
volumes.
Revenue for the last three months of the year stood at $1.73
billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.4
billion, according to LSEG data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     President Donald Trump's nominee to serve as the second highest ranking official at the U.S. Transportation Department vowed the government will take a fair and objective approach to overseeing auto safety probes into Tesla.
Asked if he would commit to ensuring auto safety regulators hold Tesla accountable, nominee Steve Bradbury said yes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in October opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) software after four reported collisions, including a fatal 2023 crash, among other open safety probes.

(This Feb. 19 story has been refiled to fix a typo in paragraph 6)
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     Federal regulators have cited Tesla for violating workplace safety rules in connection with the electrocution of a worker last summer at its Austin, Texas, auto-manufacturing plant.
The U.S. Department of Labor confirmed the findings in a statement to Reuters.
""The investigation is closed and citations have been issued,"" said the department, which oversees the agency that conducted the Tesla probe, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
The Labor Department said the matter was concluded in late January. The department declined to disclose the nature of Tesla's workplace-safety failures or whether any penalties were imposed.
The case has been closely watched amid public debate about the oversight of Tesla and other businesses run by billionaire Elon Musk as he directs a radical overhaul of federal agencies on behalf of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Musk, who spent more than $250 million to help elect Trump, now steers the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which aims to slash federal spending and staffing. Musk's businesses, including Tesla and rocket-maker SpaceX, rely heavily on government contracts, subsidies and policies.
OSHA launched the investigation immediately after the August 1 death of Victor Gomez Sr., an electrician working as a contractor at the Tesla plant in Texas, according to OSHA records and a wrongful death lawsuit filed against Tesla by Gomez's family.
Gomez was killed while inspecting electrical panels at the site, according to the suit. The lawsuit alleges negligence and argues that the panel was supposed to be inactive but had already been powered up, resulting in Gomez's electrocution.
Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not immediately access court filings by Tesla in the lawsuit.
On Wednesday, U.S. Representative Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat whose congressional district includes the Tesla plant, sent a letter to the Labor Department urging that OSHA immediately release the full results of its investigation of Gomez's death. The letter said that a refusal to release public records on Tesla's workplace safety failures could raise questions about whether the agency is giving Musk preferential treatment.
""Americans have a right to know whether Tesla and its contractors put a man's life at risk, and whether Tesla will follow workplace safety rules going forward,"" the letter read.
The plant, a 10-million square-foot facility in Austin, Texas, is a manufacturing hub for Tesla's Model Y vehicles and Cybertrucks.
OSHA records show Tesla was cited and fined about $7,000 for two other workplace safety violations at the Texas plant last year, both involving violations of rules to protect workers from chemical hazards. In 2022, the company also was hit with a pair of complaints claiming that it failed to address alleged workplace-safety and wage-law violations by subcontractors during the construction of the facility.

Copyright © BusinessAMBE 2023
Key takeaways
Talks are underway for ElonMusk's social media platform, formerly known as Twitter and now called X, to receive financing at a valuation of $44 billion. This amount corresponds to the price Musk paid to take over the company in 2022. Sources familiar with the situation have indicated that negotiations are progressing, but that the details of the funding round are still subject to change. It is also possible that X may ultimately choose to forgo fundraising altogether.
Funding round
This potential investment round would be the first since Musk made X private in 2022. The platform has faced financial difficulties following Musk's acquisition and subsequent changes to the platform, leading to a significant exodus of users and advertisers. Recent developments, however, suggest a positive shift. Fidelity Investments recently downgraded its stake in X by about 70 percent from the acquisition price, but other indicators point to growing confidence in X's future.
Financial revaluation
X's debt has also undergone a positive revaluation. Morgan Stanley successfully sold $3 billion worth of X debt last week at face value, without discount. This is a significant improvement over previous attempts to sell the debt, which met resistance from potential buyers. Strong investor demand indicates increasing confidence in X's financial stability and prospects.
AI ambitions
Elon Musk's other ventures have also achieved notable success recently. Tesla Inc, his electric vehicle company, has seen its share price rise more than 40 percent since the election of President Donald Trump, a period during which Musk has maintained close ties with the president. SpaceX, Musk's aerospace company, has reached an incredible $350 billion valuation, further cementing its status as the world's largest technology startup.
AI funding
Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is currently seeking funding at an estimated valuation of $75 billion. This proposed valuation reflects growing investor interest in Musk's AI ambitions. X owns a $6 billion stake in xAI, further reinforcing the financial interconnectedness of his various businesses. As a result, the economic performance of his companies is becoming more closely linked.
Investor confidence
The impact of Musk's close ties to President Donald Trump on perceptions of x's future is also noteworthy. Some investors believe Musk's political connections could benefit his companies, including X, by furthering their interests in regulatory and policy issues. Prominent investors who supported Musk's acquisition of X in 2022 include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and the Qatar Investment Authority. Their continued support may be crucial to the success of the current funding round.

WASHINGTON (AP) — It's been a burning political question for weeks: How long will President Donald Trump — who doesn’t like sharing the spotlight — be able to do just that with Elon Musk, a billionaire also overly fond of attention?
In a joint Fox News Channel interview that aired Tuesday, both insisted they like each other a lot and would stick with their arrangement despite what Trump said were attempts by the media to “drive us apart.”
At times, Trump sat back as Fox News Channel'sSean Hannity heaped praise on Musk in an attempt to counteract a Democratic narrative that he's a callous and unelected force out to destroy the government and upend civil society through sweeping cuts being imposed by the Department of Government Efficiency.
There were also moments when Trump and Musk were all but finishing each other's sentences, as if they were part of a buddy comedy and not the president and his most powerful aide.
Here's a look at how the friendship formed, what it means for them both and why Trump's history suggests it may not last:
Trump told Hannity that he wasn't really acquainted with Musk until recently, saying, “I knew him a little bit through the White House originally"" but didn’t know him before that.
Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and became a U.S. citizen in 2002. He's the world’s richest man, with a net worth exceeding $400 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His vast business holdings include X, Tesla and SpaceX, as well as the satellite internet service provider Starlink.
Musk said he voted for Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 and Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Musk has recently said that Tesla was being unfairly targeted by regulations in its original home state of California. Musk and the company's headquarters moved to Austin, Texas in 2021, and he increasingly soured on Biden with the then-president's embrace of unions that clashed frequently with Tesla.
In the past, Musk butted heads with Trump over climate change. They feuded as recently as July 2022 — with Trump calling Musk a “bulls—- artist."" He also suggested then that Musk came to the White House during his first term seeking federal subsidies for “electric cars that don’t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere.”
""I could have said, ‘drop to your knees and beg,’ and he would have done it,” Trump previously said on his social media site.
Musk originally backed Ron DeSantis in last year’s Republican presidential primary, even helping the Florida governor launch his White House bid in a glitch-marred presentation on X. But Musk met with Trump at his Florida residence last March and endorsed the then-canidate in July shortly after the first assassination attempt.
“I was going to do it anyway, but that was a precipitating event,” Musk told Hannity.
Musk appeared at his first Trump rally in early October, and his super PAC spent around $200 million to boost the Republican's campaign. X also amplified messaging — and often disinformation — promoted by Trump and his “Make America Great Again” movement.
The pair spent election night at the president's Mar-a-Lago club. Less than a week after securing victory, Trump announced that Musk would lead DOGE, the new push to shrink government, alongside former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who left the commission by Inauguration Day.
Trump has empowered Musk to help him keep a campaign promise and “ shatter the deep state ” by firing scores of federal workers, shrinking or shuttering agencies and slashing the size of government.
“There’s a vast federal bureaucracy that is implacably opposed to the the president,” Musk told Hannity. He added: ""What we’re seeing here is the sort of the thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try to restore democracy and the will of the people.”
Tesla and SpaceX have benefited from lucrative government contracts from the Defense Department, NASA and other federal entities, as well as plenty of tax breaks and subsidies over the years. The Trump administration could also take a lot of regulatory heat off Musk, including dismissing crash investigations into Tesla’s partially automated vehicles and a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars’ self-driving capabilities.
Musk nonetheless insisted to Hannity, “I haven’t asked the president for anything, ever."" Trump said the billionaire “won't be involved” in areas where his government efforts and business concerns overlap — though that seems dubious given that Musk's team has already begun scrutinizing federal contracts in areas that would seem to present conflict-of-interest concerns.
Trump and Musk say they won't turn on each other. But those once closest to Trump often end up as his fiercest critics.
His former vice president, Mike Pence, said Trump endangered his family in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol and attempted to bully him into violating the Constitution. His former attorney general, Bill Barr, refuted Trump's falsehoods about widespread fraud in the 2020 election and has since said he “shouldn't be anywhere near the Oval Office.""
Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime lawyer who testified against him in a hush money case, told a House committee in 2019: “People that follow Mr. Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering.”
More recently, Trump shrugged off potential security risks while ending Secret Service protection for former top officials in his first administration, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former White House chief of staff John Kelly.
Trump also has shown repeatedly that he doesn't like being overshadowed, even hinting at such where Musk is concerned. Asked recently about Musk appearing on the cover of Time from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Trump quipped, “Is Time Magazine still in business?”
But Trump has also been fiercely loyal to those he perceives as having stood by him.
Former White House adviser Peter Navarro, who served time in prison related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, is back helping dictate Trump trade policy. Trump's valet, Walt Nauta, is working anew at the White House after once being a codefendant with Trump in the classified documents case. Trump has also said he'd offered “about 10 jobs” to his former national security adviser, Mike Flynn, whom he pardoned after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.
Throughout the interview, Hannity was friendly and his questions were mostly fawning. But what came through was how complimentary Trump and Musk were of each other — even amid skepticism about how long that'll last.
“He’s an amazing person,” Trump said of Musk.
“I love the president, I just want to be clear about that,” Musk offered of Trump.
“I feel like I’m interviewing two brothers here,” Hannity finally said.

Tesla,2025-02-19,Tesla selects showroom sites in New Delhi and Mumbai – report,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e7a3174b7398ed27d498d79dd18bd6a993ff4ee2ee3cb0863e4f84cf8b93d25e,The selection of showroom spaces follows a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the US last week.,"The selection of showroom spaces follows a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the US last week. 
Tesla has identified sites for showrooms in New Delhi and Mumbai, marking progress in its strategy to enter India’s automotive market, reported Reuters.  
The US carmaker has been seeking showroom spaces since late last year, after pausing its market entry plans in 2022.  

                        The gold standard of business intelligence.

The selection of showroom spaces follows a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the US last week, where they discussed space, mobility, and technology.  
Tesla has secured a lease in the Aerocity area near New Delhi’s international airport, two anonymous sources familiar with the discussions told the news agency. 
Aerocity is known for its hotels, retail outlets, and global corporate offices.  
In Mumbai, Tesla has opted for space in the Bandra Kurla Complex, a business and retail hub near the city’s airport.  
Both showrooms will be approximately 5,000ft2 in size, as per the source. 
While opening dates for the showrooms are yet to be decided, Tesla plans to sell imported electric vehicles (EVs) in India.  
These locations are designated for showrooms, not service centres, and Tesla will manage the outlets.  
Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Additionally, Tesla has posted job advertisements for 13 mid-level positions in India, including store and customer relationship managers.  
Musk has previously criticised India’s high import tariffs of around 100% on EVs, which Tesla has lobbied to reduce. 
Local automakers have resisted Tesla’s entry, fearing it could impact their EV plans. Despite ongoing discussions, Tesla hesitated due to high import duties.  
Recently, India reduced its basic customs duty on vehicles priced above $40,000 from 110% to 70%. 
US President Donald Trump recently highlighted India’s high car duties but agreed with Modi to pursue an early trade deal to resolve tariff issues.  
Although India’s EV sector is smaller than China’s, it offers Tesla an opportunity amid declining sales, marking its first yearly drop in EV deliveries in over a decade.  
India recorded nearly 100,000 EV sales last year, while China achieved 11 million.

NEW YORK (AP) — The S&P 500 added to its record as U.S. stock indexes drifted through a quiet, mixed day on Wall Street. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% on Wednesday after setting an all-time high the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite inched up by 0.1%. Elon Musk’s Tesla was one of the strongest forces lifting the market. It helped offset a sharp drop for Celanese after the chemical company warned of weakness in some of its markets. Treasury yields eased a bit. Stock indexes fell in Europe after finishing mixed in Asia.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
NEW YORK (AP) — The S&P 500 is inching higher as U.S. stock indexes drift through a quiet Wednesday on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 was adding 0.3% to the all-time high it set the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually unchanged, with an hour of trading remaining, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% higher.
Elon Musk's Tesla was one of the strongest forces lifting the market, and it rose 2.3%. It climbed after another electric-vehicle company, Nikola, plunged 37.5% following its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The electric truck maker said it will try to sell off its assets and wind down its business.
A 9.6% rally for Analog Devices also helped push the S&P 500 higher. The semiconductor company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, despite what CEO Vincent Roche called a “challenging macro and geopolitical backdrop.”
They helped offset a 22.8% tumble for Celanese, which dropped even though the chemical company reported profit for the end of 2024 that topped analysts’ expectations. CEO Scott Richardson warned that it saw “demand deterioration that gave no sign of easing” during the last three months of the year, and the company expects weakness to continue for such core markets as automotive, construction and paints.
Toll Brothers, meanwhile, fell 5.7% after the homebuilder reported a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Douglas Yearley Jr. said this spring selling season has seen healthy demand so far for homes at the higher end of the price spectrum, but “affordability constraints” are hurting sales at the lower end.
A separate report on Wednesday morning said homebuilders as a group broke ground on fewer U.S. houses last month than economists expected.
High mortgage rates are making it difficult for some potential homebuyers to afford a house, even though the Federal Reserve began cutting its main interest rate in September in order to make things easier for the economy.
Mortgage rates have followed the trend of longer-term Treasury yields, which have remained relatively high in part because the U.S. economy has remained remarkably solid and because inflation hasn’t eased as much as hoped. Tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump, along with other policies that could put upward pressure on inflation, have also caused some sharp swings for yields in the bond market.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury stayed relatively calm Wednesday and edged down to 4.53% from 4.55% late Tuesday. It was below 3.70% as recently as September and approaching 4.80% within the past few weeks.
Both the bond and the stock markets have increasingly been taking Trump's tariffs in stride, after earlier showing much more trepidation. The hope on Wall Street is that Trump is using such threats merely as a tool to drive negotiations, and the ultimate effects won't be as bad as they initially appeared.
Such a calm response, though, could make things worse if conditions don't go as Wall Street expects, or if it emboldens Trump to make even more forceful actions.
For its part, the Federal Reserve has signaled it may make fewer cuts this year than earlier expected, in part because of worries that inflation will remain stubbornly above its 2% target. Cutting rates can boost the economy and juice prices for investments, but they can also give inflation more fuel.
Minutes released Wednesday for the Fed's last policy meeting in January showed officials discussed how Trump's proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, as well as strong consumer spending, could push inflation higher this year
In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.6% after a report showed U.K. inflation accelerated to a 10-month high. That could put pressure on the Bank of England, which had been cutting interest rates to invigorate its tepid economy.
Indexes fell more than 1% in other European markets, including in France and Germany, after finishing mixed across Asia. South Korea's Kospi jumped 1.7%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3%.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump has said that if Tesla were to build a factory in India to circumvent that country's tariffs, it would be ""unfair"" to the U.S., in an interview with Fox News which aired on Tuesday.
Trump called out India's high duty on cars during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the U.S. last week, but agreed to work towards an early trade deal and resolve their standoff over tariffs.
Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has long criticised India for having import tariffs of around 100% on EVs which protect local automakers such as Tata Motors in the world's third largest auto market, where EV adoption is still at a nascent stage.
Trump said it is ""impossible"" for Musk to sell a car in the South Asian nation.
""Every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs... It is impossible to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India,"" he said.
India's government in March unveiled a new EV policy lowering import taxes substantially to 15% if a carmaker invests at least $500 million and sets up a factory.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Tesla has selected locations for two showrooms in the Indian cities of New Delhi and Mumbai, and posted job ads for 13 mid-level roles in India. It does not currently manufacture any vehicles in India.
Trump said it would be ""unfair"" to the U.S. if Musk did decide to build a factory there.
""Now, if he built the factory in India, that's okay, but that's unfair to us. It's very unfair,"" Trump said in the interview.
India's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump's plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes U.S. imports have raised the risk of a global trade war with American friends and foes.

From the hotly-debated high-flier Tesla (TSLA), Wall Street’s newest darling Rivian (RIVN), traditional-stalwarts turned EV-upstarts GM (GM) and Ford (F) to the numerous SPAC-deal makers that have come public in this red-hot space, The Fly has you covered with “Charged,” a weekly recap of the top stories and expert calls in the sector.
AUTONOMOUS DRIVING LICENSE: Tesla is preparing for a potential delay in obtaining Chinese approval for its autonomous driving technology and the company has been told there is no definitive timetable for regulators to approve a license for it to begin widespread training of its “full self-driving” technology, despite an earlier indication that it would get the go ahead in the second quarter of 2025, people with knowledge of the matter told Financial Times‘ Zijing Wu and Stephen Morris.
GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES: Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg initiated coverage of Tesla with a Buy rating and $475 price target. In addition to continued proliferation of the electric vehicle market, Tesla has multiple opportunities to fuel growth, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, and energy generation/storage, the firm tells investors. Benchmark sees the release of more affordable Tesla models in 2025 as “a key catalyst for the stock,” adding that its model has only baked in vehicle growth, “providing significant potential upside should autonomous vehicles and Optimus achieve scale.”
HUMANOID ROBOTICS: Morgan Stanley notes Bloomberg reports that humanoid robot startup Figure AI is in talks to raise $1.5B in a deal that, if confirmed, would value the company at $39.5B. This would value Figure more than Ford and on par with Stellantis (STLA) and be a greater than 15 times increase in Figure’s valuation as the company was previously valued at $2.6B after a Series B funding round in February 2024 that was participated in by OpenAI, Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), the firm tells investors. Bloomberg also reports that Meta (META) is planning to form a new team to conduct work on humanoid robots, the analyst added. Morgan Stanley, which continues to view Tesla as “one of the leading enablers of humanoid robotics in the Western world,” anticipates growing investor interest in Tesla’s role in this potential “multi-trillion” addressable end-market and notes that its current valuation of Tesla does not factor in any value for Optimus. The firm keeps an Overweight rating and $430 price target on Tesla shares.
PLANS ON HOLD: The State Department said that it had put plans to buy armored electric vehicles on hold after reports that the $400M order would go to Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk is a close adviser of President Trump, reported The New York Times‘ Jack Ewing. “The solicitation is on hold, and there are no current plans to issue it,” the State Department is quoted as having said.

EV SALES TAX: A group of Senate Republicans proposed a $1,000 tax on new electric vehicle purchases to account for the cost of federal road repairs, David Shepardson of Reuters reports. The one-time $1,000 fee charged at the time of purchase would be roughly equivalent to what drivers of conventional vehicles pay in federal gas taxes over 10 years for highway funds, said Senator Deb Fischer, the lead sponsor of the measure. Electric vehicle carmakers include Tesla, Rivian Automotive, Lucid Group (LCID), Ford, General Motors, and Toyota (TM).
BUY LUCID: Benchmark initiated coverage of Lucid Group with a Buy rating and $5 price target. After a pause in 2024, domestic electric vehicle production is expected to improve in 2025 and further accelerate in 2026-27 as average selling prices decline and the charging infrastructure is built out, the firm tells investors. In that context, Benchmark views Lucid as “well positioned to achieve significant share of this burgeoning opportunity,” citing its technology, balance sheet, access to capital, Saudi investment, partnerships, “award-winning vehicles” and “highly integrated manufacturing capabilities,” the firm tells investors.

The amount of the tariff and what the negotiation standpoint is still unknown,"" Lopez explains.She highlights that industries like the automotive sector, with a strong US presence, may have a better chance of negotiating exemptions.

President Donald Trump threatening those levies of 25% or more on semiconductor imports. So joining us now with more on this, we got Maribel Lopez, the founder of Lopez Research. Maribel, it's great to have you on here. I want to talk specifically about the impact of these tariffs on some of these chips names, in particular that drove the market to all-time highs early this week. Is the market missing something sinister when it comes to tariffs, or is the market right to kind of be sloughing off any potential negative impact? 
This is really an opening volley by Trump to say he's really serious about tariffs. Tariffs will happen. The amount of the tariff and what the negotiation standpoint is is still unknown. So this is like, hey, I'm throwing it out there. You're going to come to me, we're going to have a negotiation, we're going to try to figure out how you were going to invest more in America. And that's really what I see as the statement that Trump is making here. This is why we're looking at April and not tomorrow. If we're looking at April, there's plenty of time for someone like TSMC to call and say, hey, here's how we're feeling about investing more in foundries in the US as an example. Same for Samsung and other companies that already build chips here, but not at a very significant standpoint. 
Are there industries that you think are more likely to be successful making sure that they're included in an exemptions or an exclusions list as they try to vie for the ear and and the mind of the President? 
So some companies actually already have a strong foothold. You mentioned the automotive industry. If you look at somebody like BMW, they already manufacture a significant portion of what they sell in the US, upwards of about 50% in the US. So they actually have a better negotiating ability than say Samsung who does manufacture some goods here, such as some of their home products, but not necessarily enough. So we're seeing that it is widely unevenly distributed across the various companies and across the various sectors. But I think the call to action for everybody right now is to try to figure out what they can do to make a play to say that they're going to invest in America to either create manufacturing jobs, to create investment in some other type of category that we would consider as beneficial to the economy. And this is why the fund managers are not overreacting to the statement at this point because they understand at this moment, it's still a negotiation. 
So it sounds like you think the market is right to view this as that negotiation, not as something more serious. But do you think that the Trump administration is kind of angling towards universal tariffs by throwing out these larger numbers, like a 25% to kick off those negotiations, and could there be risk associated with that? 
I think they're incredibly serious about tariffs across the board. I think this is definitely a statement that says, no industry, no country will remain unscathed by tariffs, and that you have to have a plan on how to work with us. We are serious about rebalancing, whatever they think rebalancing means, but they have definitely indicated that they are serious about it. So the real thing to watch here to your earlier point is, when do they come in effect, how long do we expect them to be in effect, and what would be considered a sufficient and necessary investment in the US. But clearly, there are many companies that are looking at this saying, if you were a auto manufacturer, say in Japan, if you are a semiconductor manufacturer in Taiwan, you're looking at, what could this do to my profitability? How do I find a way to make sure that there's a sufficient investment that we don't end up with a 25% tariff, which is a significant number for any company.

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) secured showroom locations in New Delhi and Mumbai as it moves ahead with plans to enter the Indian market.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.
With no imminent plans for service facilities, the developer of electric cars is concentrating on retail environments.
Tesla has chosen a location in the Aerocity region of New Delhi, a commercial center close to the international airport that contains corporate offices, hotels, and retail stores. The firm has decided on a site in Bandra Kurla Complex, a big commercial and retail area close to the airport in Mumbai. Every showroom is supposed to be around 5,000 square feet (464.52 square meters).
For its operations in India, Tesla has also started recruiting; it has posted job ads for 13 mid-level positions including store and customer relations managers.
The company's arrival into India coincides with government obstacles like hefty import taxes on electric cars. India levies almost perfect import taxes, a policy Tesla has attacked. Citing rivalry, domestic manufacturers have also rebelled against Tesla's entrance. Leaders from both nations have agreed to pursue a trade agreement that would affect auto taxes, therefore addressing the problem via U.S.-India trade negotiations.
Originally postponing its intentions for development in India until 2022, Tesla began its hunt for showroom space in late 2023. Though it has not yet stated the opening date for the additional sites, the firm keeps advancing with its market launch.

The website Spend-elon-fortune.com starts by giving you an imaginary bank account filled with Musk's estimated wealth. Users can go on a virtual shopping trip, picking things like video game systems, private islands, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) robots, and even an NFL team, which costs about $3 billion.

The website recently went viral on Reddit, where thousands of users tried their hand at spending Musk's wealth. One person said they “bought everything they realistically wanted” and barely cracked $2 billion. Another user joked, “I barely cracked $300 million, and I bought the entire Senate.” Some attempted to give away large sums, but even donating $10,000 to 5,000 people only accounted for $50 million, a tiny fraction of the total.
Many users pointed out how absurd it is for one person to control that much wealth.
Trending: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly don't own yet. See which asset class has outpaced the S&P 500 (1995-2024) – and with near-zero correlation.
The exercise is fun, but it also highlights the massive scale of wealth inequality. Some Reddit users suggested that the website should include options like “end world hunger” or “fund universal healthcare” to see how many global issues could be solved with Musk's fortune.
Musk's fortune fluctuates daily, largely due to the performance of Tesla stock, which makes up a significant portion of his net worth. Earlier this month, his fortune dipped below $400 billion for the first time this year due to a drop in Tesla’s stock price, but it quickly rebounded.
While most of us will never have anywhere near Musk's level of wealth, this website provides an eye-opening look at just how much money he has. Whether you want to fund startups, buy an entire fleet of private jets, or just stack up on PlayStation 5s, it turns out that even spending hundreds of billions of dollars is no easy feat.

A federal judge just handed a temporary win to Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), denying an emergency bid to block their access to federal data systems and workforce cuts. Judge Tanya Chutkan acknowledged concerns over Musk's sweeping authority but ruled that the states hadn't proven immediate harm. The lawsuit, filed by multiple attorneys general, argues that Musk's role bypasses the Constitution's Appointments Clause, which requires Senate confirmation. While this ruling keeps DOGE's mandate intact for now, legal battles are far from over, and investors should watch how this fight unfolds.
Under Musk's leadership, DOGE has aggressively slashed government jobs and dismantled key programs, sparking major legal and political scrutiny. Critics argue these rapid moves are destabilizing critical state-run initiatives and federal operations. While some courts have temporarily restricted DOGE's access to Treasury systems, others have allowed it to continue accessing internal databases. The mixed rulings highlight the ongoing uncertainty around Musk's government influence, and markets tied to federal contracts and regulatory oversight could see increased volatility in the near term.
Musk's deepening role in federal operations adds another layer of risk for investors, particularly those with stakes in companies reliant on government policy. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX, both helmed by Musk, might face heightened regulatory scrutiny as the legal drama intensifies. Meanwhile, states pushing back against DOGE's influence could create further disruptions, amplifying unpredictability for industries linked to federal spending. With multiple lawsuits still in play, investors should brace for more twists in this unprecedented battle over Musk's government footprint.

Tesla,2025-02-19,The one thing Elon Musk doesn't tweet about: Tariffs,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d62e7062e4802be9616e81381fad59465ba88895f1b7febf8863d4b9132b7dfd,Elon Musk posts a lot but one subject was glaringly absent in recent weeks: President Donald Trump's tariff plans.,"Oops, something went wrong
Elon Musk undoubtedly tweets a lot, recently offering about 270 posts, reposts, or comments to his X platform during the 24 hours of Presidents' Day. It was an average day for him.
But one subject has been glaringly absent in spite of Musk's 10+ post-per-hour velocity in the early weeks of Trump 2.0: the president's tariff plans.
In fact, a variety of searches of Musk's posting history using the X search engine for terms like ""tariff"" or ""import duty"" revealed minimal to no results. And when the topic does pop up, it's invariably in a post that is years old and sounds very different from how Donald Trump talks about the issue today.
At one point in 2018, Musk even directed a message at Trump during his first term by saying, ""I am against import duties in general,"" as he also agreed with Trump's general objection to foreign duties on cars.
More recently, the tariff mentions from Musk appear to have dropped to zero. A Yahoo Finance review of many of Musk's tweets in recent weeks couldn't find a single direct mention by Musk, one way or the other, on tariffs.
Plenty of recent posts have praised Trump's agenda in broad terms but without noting tariffs specifically.
But that doesn't mean tariffs have necessarily been far from Musk's mind — or that Trump's trade agenda couldn't end up helping Musk's business interests depending on how it shakes out.
It's a dynamic that underlines how Musk, in addition to his role as ""first buddy"" and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), also remains the CEO of multiple companies that could stand to gain or lose profits.
The tension was perhaps on no starker display than when Musk — who is also the Tesla (TSLA) CEO — met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a visit to Washington last week as EV tariffs from that country sit as a key agenda item.
Trump recently announced a plan for reciprocal tariffs as his administration launches negotiations on a one-by-one basis with nations that could be impacted. Talks with India are already underway to determine whether Trump can force Modi's government to lower duties on things like EVs (which could clearly help a company like Tesla) or whether reciprocal tariffs will mean hikes in duties from both sides.
Read more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?
Musk's rare discussions of tariffs online over the years have often touched on reciprocity primarily as a means to drive down duties. At one point in 2020, he noted of the US/UK trading relationship that the ideal is ""no tariffs at all either way.""
Trump has clearly offered a very different public message. He often touts the duties as good for their own sake and as a way to raise revenue.
Just on Tuesday afternoon, the president told reporters he is looking at auto tariffs ""in the neighborhood of 25%"" and that he plans to announce them around April 2. He added that new duties on semiconductors and pharmaceutical products are also in the offing.
Trump has also implemented new 10% tariffs on China with many others threatened to go into effect in the coming weeks and months.
Musk's public stance is similar to certain other Republicans who tend to lean in a free trade direction but, for now, are content to keep their objections to Trump's trade war plans at a low volume or muted completely.
And the tariff topic clearly hasn't dampened Musk's enthusiasm for Trump and his agenda, as was in evidence when the two men sat for a warm joint interview on Fox News (where the topic of tariffs never came up) and in a memorable recent post from Musk, reading, ""I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man.""
But his relative public silence on tariffs — and possible behind the scenes maneuvering in the case of India — has become one of many criticisms lobbed at Musk from his political opponents.
Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, recently blasted Musk's meeting with Modi by charging that Musk was sitting in a formal government setting ""for concessions that would make him rich"" — calling it ""shameless corruption at a scale never seen before in our history.""
A summary of the meeting from Modi said the conversation touched on a variety of topics including ""furthering ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance.’""
But whether Musk is pushing in different directions in his role as a CEO versus that of a government employee is a topic that apparently isn't overly concerning to Trump.
The president was recently asked by reporters whether Musk approached his meeting with Modi as a CEO or as a White House adviser. Trump said he didn't know.
""I assume he wants to do business in India, but India's a very hard place to do business in because of the tariffs,"" Trump added.
""You could call him an employee, you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want,"" Trump added as he weighed in on the topic again this week.
But one area of Musk's previously expressed views on tariffs may have resonated with Trump.
Musk has posted multiple times in recent years about the impact that local value-added taxes (VATs) have on the varying prices of Tesla cars.
""Prices in the US (of all goods) don't include VAT, but it's usually included in other countries,"" Musk noted in 2021.
Trump recently announced his plan for reciprocal tariffs with a memo that offered a specific discussion of how non-tariff barriers like a VAT would be part of the reciprocity conversation.
""For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff,"" Trump noted on Truth Social.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who serves on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the President Donald Trump administration sparked a discussion about Social Security Administration (SSA) data accuracy on Tuesday, sharing statistics showing millions of Americans over 100 years old listed as alive in the system.
What Happened: University of Michigan economics professor Justin Wolfers provided context, citing a July 2023 SSA Inspector General audit report that identified approximately 18.9 million number holders born before 1920 without death information in their records.
The audit report revealed that 98% of these cases receive no payments, with the anomaly largely attributed to pre-electronic record-keeping era deaths. The SSA has declined previous recommendations to update these records, citing implementation costs between $5-10 million and limited benefit to current programs.

“Should government databases be cleaner? It’s a cost-benefit question,” Wolfers noted on X, suggesting the issue might not be a major concern given the low rate of active payments.
Musk, who shared age distribution data showing over 4.7 million individuals aged 100-109 in the system, responded with humor, referencing the “Twilight” vampire series and suggesting supernatural explanations for the longevity statistics.

Trending: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?
Why It Matters: The discussion comes amid broader concerns about federal data management. The SSA has defended its position, arguing that updating non-beneficiary records would divert resources from current operations. The agency maintains that other entities can independently assess presumed death based on age.
The debate highlights ongoing challenges in modernizing legacy government systems while balancing resource allocation and operational priorities. Despite the apparent discrepancies, the audit confirms that actual improper payments remain minimal among these historical records.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other AI stocks.
Tiger Brokers, an online brokerage firm, has recently revealed that it has embedded DeepSeek's model into its AI-powered chatbot. The DeepSeek-R1 model integrated into TigerGPT signifies a strategic move made by the firm to enhance the platform’s capabilities and user experience. The move comes amid brokerages and money managers racing to leverage the start-up's artificial intelligence breakthrough.

Other Chinese brokers and fund managers who have integrated DeepSeek’s model include Sinolink Securities, CICC Wealth Management, and China Universal Asset Management. Their integrations have allowed them to radicalize how they conduct research, manage risks, make investment decisions, and even interact with clients.
The R1 model will allow Tiger Brokers to help customers analyze valuations, and make trading decisions and as Wu Tianhua, Tiger Brokers' founder and CEO puts it, ""feel the beauty of investment”, all by tapping on their financial data.
""Its impact is real. It's no longer a concept, or a marketing trick,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Chinese firms may be integrating DeepSeek fast into their operations, but tech firms in the US are racing hard to develop their own. In the latest news, Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI has revealed the Grok-3 model, a version of its chatbot that is launched to rival OpenAI merely days after Musk’s unsolicited cash bid to buy the company was rejected.
Grok-3 is available to Premium+ subscribers on X. The service costs $22 a month. In comparison, full access to OpenAI’s GPT-4o costs $200 a month. xAI has also revealed its plans to start a new subscription called SuperGrok for the bot’s mobile app and Grok.com website. Bloomberg reported that xAI plans to open-source preceding versions of Grok models as soon as the latest one is fully mature. This move coincides with similar ones made by other AI firms after the launch of DeepSeek’s AI models, reflecting a broader AI trend toward transparency and collaboration.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On February 18, analyst Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock and kept the price target at $430.00.
Tesla’s strategic positioning in the automotive and technology sectors, particularly its focus on innovation and leadership in electric vehicles (EVs), has led to the rating. Moreover, the company’s ability to integrate cutting-edge technology and sustainable energy solutions, strong financial performance, and expanding production capabilities make the investment particularly appealing. In addition, Tesla is expanding in autonomous driving technology and energy storage solutions, which further enhances its long-term prospects.
“We continue to view Tesla as one of the leading enablers of humanoid robotics in the Western world and anticipate growing investor interest in TSLA’s role in this potential multi-trillion TAM end-market”.
Overall TSLA ranks 5th on our list of the buzzing AI stocks dominating headlines. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Have Musk’s political endeavours had a negative impact on Tesla?
In January 2025, there were a record number of electric vehicle (EV) registrations in the UK, Europe’s largest battery-electric market, according to data from New Automotive. Yet Tesla’s UK sales declined 12% from the previous year in January 2025, dropping from 1,604 registrations to 1,416. Tesla suffered its first-ever annual decline in deliveries in 2024 despite being the leading EV seller in the US and the largest car company in the world by market capitalization. Overall, 2025 global Tesla sales in January were down a massive 50.4% YoY.
Europe seems like an especially painful region for the automotive company, as in January 2025 German sales dropped 60% on the previous year, French sales dropped 63%, Spanish sales dropped 75% YoY, and Dutch sales dropped 42.5% YoY.

Overall, Tesla’s European sales in January 2025 were down 48% on the same period of the previous year. Tesla isn’t fully at fault for this slump, given that 2024 European battery-electric vehicle registrations fell 27% in comparison to 2023, according to GlobalData. The European EV market has certainly shrunk, yet Tesla is shrinking far more than expected. Tesla is still selling thousands of cars, but they’re selling far fewer than they did this time last year.
Since acquiring Twitter (now X) in 2022, Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, has become more vocal on political issues. Over the last year, the tech billionaire has involved himself in far-right European politics. Has this contributed to declining Tesla sales in the region?
The past five years have been a political adventure
Once a beloved champion of environmental capitalism, Musk has gone from the center-left of the political spectrum to a position firmly on the right. Musk voted for Democratic candidates in US elections between 2008 and 2020, according to the billionaire, only switching to Republican in 2024. Since endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in July 2024, he has donated over $200 million to the Trump cause, with Trump gifting him the unofficial position of head of the department of government efficiency (DOGE).
In recent months, Musk has turned his attention to Europe. In January 2025, he appeared at election campaign events held by Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), a party that advocates for the resettlement of people with a migrant background. As German Tesla sales drop by 60%, Schmidt Automotive Research has said that German EV buyers “may well be reacting to Musk’s comments” at the AfD rally. As Musk’s political actions become seen as more extreme (or at least off the mainstream), Europeans’ interest in Tesla may decrease even more. 
Intensifying competition, aging product lineup, regulatory pressures
However, there are other reasons why Tesla sales are slumping. Chinese companies like BYD, Chery, and Geely are producing new, cheap models that are gaining market share in Europe. These companies are also constructing or have already constructed facilities in Europe. BYD has an $8.2 billion battery plant in Hungary and Chery has a production facility in Spain. BYD saw a 550% increase in UK registrations in 2024.
Tesla’s lineup is also, by most accounts, getting a bit stale. No new model has been introduced in Europe since the Model Y in 2021. A refresh of the Model Y is set to come out in mid-2025, which might be another reason why consumers are holding off on buying a new Tesla. Musk’s next project, an autonomous vehicle, is unlikely to pass strict European regulations. Tesla also has a low number of cars in stock at this time of the year as Musk’s company typically pushes sales in Q4 to boost end-of-year sales.
In conclusion
Ultimately, a January slump in Tesla sales was expected. The European EV market is contracting, Tesla’s lineup is stale, its inventory is low, and foreign competition is increasing dramatically. Nor is Tesla giving up market share without a fight. It is updating the Model Y, expanding its gigafactory in Berlin, and investing in supercharger network growth. However, this might not be enough, and Musk’s political stances have clearly affected consumer sentiment. Even in the US, specifically California, Musk’s company saw sales contract by 12% in 2024.
Tesla is at an inflection point in its history. Its CEO is standing shoulder to shoulder with the most powerful man in the world, yet faces slumping sales in his largest business. The first six months of 2025 will be definitive for Tesla as it tries to combat market competition, its worsening image in Europe, and consumer sentiment. Tesla’s image may soon become irreparably damaged on the continent. Musk is closely linked with Donald Trump, and the US president is not popular in Europe; only 22% of Europeans polled thinking that Trump as the president will be a good thing according to a survey from the European Council on Foreign Relations (EFCR) in January 2025. Trump is also not a fan of Europe, calling it a “mini-China” and threatening the European Union with tariffs. 
In contrast to Tesla’s struggles, Musk’s other main business interests (X and SpaceX) stand to benefit from his proximity to Trump through government contracts and increased social media traffic. Tesla is far more dependent on consumer sentiment and fluctuating demand than X and SpaceX. This is not the end for Tesla in Europe, but the coming months will indicate the scale of the challenge it faces in the region.

Key Points
Viking Global Investors' billionaire chief kicked Tesla to the curb in the December-ended quarter in favor of an industry-leading company with phenomenal subscription pricing power.
Important data releases aren't hard to come by on Wall Street. Every week, investors are privy to economic data and quarterly operating results from some of America's most-influential businesses. But Friday, Feb. 14, was a particularly special day for investors -- and it has nothing to do with Valentine's Day.
No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F offers a snapshot that allows investors to see which stocks Wall Street's leading money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter. February 14 marked the deadline for 13Fs to be filed for the December-ended quarter.

Although Warren Buffett rightly garners a lot of interest, he's far from the only billionaire asset manager that makes waves on Wall Street. Smart investors also pay close attention to billionaire Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors, who closed out 2024 with $30.9 billion in AUM spread across 86 stocks.
Halvorsen and his team run an active fund, with the average holding length of Viking Global's top-20 positions coming in at less than one year. This makes his buying and selling decisions all the more intriguing for everyday investors.
During the fourth quarter, Halvorsen sent shares of North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker packing, and more than doubled his fund's stake in a high-flying company that may be Wall Street's next stock-split stock.
Though Halvorsen completely exited more than one dozen positions during the December-ended quarter, perhaps none stands out more than selling all 436,272 shares of EV maker Tesla (TSLA -5.49%), which was a position worth more than $114 million, as of Sept. 30.
A lot has gone right for Tesla, as evidenced by its inclusion in the ""Magnificent Seven."" It's became the first automaker in more than a half-century to build itself from the ground up to mass production, and recently reported its fifth consecutive year of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit.
Additionally, CEO Elon Musk is attempting to spread Tesla's wings beyond the traditional (and highly cyclical) auto industry. The company's rapidly growing energy generation and storage segment, coupled with its Supercharger network, may be able to smooth out some of the cyclical ebb-and-flow that can affect auto stocks.
Selling Viking Global Investors' stake in Tesla might represent nothing more than simple profit-taking. Following Donald Trump's November victory, shares of Tesla skyrocketed up to 91% in six weeks. The return of Trump to the White House has been viewed as a positive for Tesla, with Musk working as a special government employee for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
But there may be other more nefarious reasons why Viking Global's billionaire chief chose to kick Tesla to the curb.
To begin with, Tesla's vehicle margin has plummeted due to growing competition and waning demand for EVs. Since the start of 2023, Tesla slashed the price for its fleet of EVs (Models 3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions. While this has helped to reduce inventory a bit in recent quarters, it's decimated the company's vehicle margin and weighed heavily on its profits.
There's also the obvious concern that Elon Musk is spending most of his time overseeing DOGE instead of running Tesla. Tesla's otherworldly valuation premium derives, in part, from investors believing in Musk's vision for the future. Distractions like DOGE may cause Tesla to fall short of various growth expectations.
Another potential issue is that Tesla generates a sizable percentage of its net income from unsustainable and non-innovative sources. More than half of the company's 2024 pre-tax profit could be traced back to regulatory automotive credits, interest income earned on its cash, and digital asset value adjustments -- Tesla holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The point being that Tesla's operations aren't responsible for the lion's share of its profit.
Lastly, Halvorsen might be concerned with Musk's inability to meet deadlines and hold true to his promises. Many of Musk's promises, such as robotaxis and Level 5 full self-driving (FSD), are already baked into Tesla's valuation. However, Tesla is nowhere close to L5 FSD, and it hasn't put a single robotaxi on public roads. If these unfulfilled promises were backed out of Tesla's market cap, a case can be made that its share price would plunge.

On the other end of the spectrum, Ole Andreas Halvorsen was mashing the buy button during the fourth quarter to add to Viking Global's position in streaming-services provider Netflix (NFLX -2.60%). Halvorsen oversaw the purchase of 297,317 shares of Netflix stock, which increase his fund's stake by a cool 145% from Sept. 30.
Why Netflix? For one, it's the undisputed leader in streaming services. It ended 2024 with 301.63 million global streaming paid memberships and is one of a select few streaming providers that's shown it's recurringly profitable.
To build on this point, streaming net additions have, for the most part, reaccelerated. The 18.91 million paid net additions during the fourth quarter represents the biggest quarterly increase in years, and it firmly puts a short-lived period of paid-member growth stagnation from 2022 in the rearview mirror.
One of the key catalysts behind Netflix's rapidly growing subscriber base is its content library. More specifically, Netflix has produced more original shows than any other streaming platform. Shows like Squid Game, Wednesday, and Stranger Things are helping to keep members loyal to Netflix, as well as luring in new subscribers.
The company's efforts to crack down on password sharing have also been a positive. Requiring users to create accounts has juiced the company's paid membership, as well as increased Netflix's subscription-pricing power. Last month, Netflix announced it would be increasing subscriptions by $1 to $2.50 per month, depending on the tier.
Adding to this long list of catalysts, Netflix is benefiting from its out-of-the-box innovation. The introduction of an ad-supported tier in November 2022 appears to have kick-started a resurgence in new member additions. Since Netflix's ad tier debuted, it's picked up 70 million paying subscribers.
Ole Andreas Halvorsen might also be counting on stock-split euphoria to take shape. Netflix stock ended Feb. 14 at $1,058.60 per share. The last time the company conducted a forward stock split was in 2015, with its shares trading for around $700 at the time. A quadruple-digit share price might make it difficult for Netflix to appeal to everyday investors -- especially those who can't purchase fractional shares with their broker.
Based on an analysis from Bank of America Global Research, companies conducting forward splits have handily outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 in the 12 months following their split announcement, with an average gain of 25.4% compared to 11.9% for the S&P 500 since 1980.  Considering how pricey Netflix stock is amid an already expensive stock market, a split announcement could go a long way to powering its shares even higher.

Key Points
If you're a fan of Westerns, you may think of the silver screen when someone says The Magnificent Seven -- a film by the name came out in 1960. But the name also refers to a group of stocks that have powered index gains through this bull market so far. Each of these companies is involved in the industry of technology, and they also have invested in the hottest tech area of all in recent times: artificial intelligence (AI).
These seven players have seen their shares climb along with revenue -- and investors are generally optimistic about these companies' long-term prospects too. After this top performance, with most Magnificent Seven players advancing in the double digits over the past year, you may expect their valuations to be sky-high. But that isn't necessarily the case. Let's meet the cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven right now -- and consider whether it's a buy.
Image source: Getty Images.
First, though, a quick look at the members of this elite list of movers. And they are: Alphabet (GOOG -3.23%) (GOOGL -3.17%), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Each of these stocks, except Microsoft, has climbed in the double digits over the past year. This is as investors piled into companies developing or using AI products and services with the idea that this technology could generate explosive growth over time.
Some of these players already are seeing the benefits. For example, Nvidia, the top maker of AI chips, has seen revenue climb in the double or triple digits quarter after quarter. And Amazon, the world's top cloud services provider, says its cloud unit already is delivering an annual revenue run rate of $115 billion thanks to its AI offerings.
Now, let's turn to the question of valuations. Certain members of the Magnificent Seven trade at levels some investors may consider high -- such as Tesla, trading for more than 120 times forward earnings estimates. But one particular Magnificent Seven stock, in spite of climbing 31% over the past year, today trades for only 20 times forward earnings estimates -- the cheapest of the group by this measure.
I'm talking about Alphabet, owner of the world's most popular search engine, Google, and the high-growth cloud services provider, Google Cloud. Though Alphabet's stock has climbed, earnings too have advanced recently and over the long term. This is thanks to the company's dominance in search and the fact that this leads to strong revenue growth -- advertisers pay to advertise their products and services across Google, where they know they can easily reach us.
Though Alphabet dominates the search market, with about 90% share, and has proved its ability to grow revenue over time, the company hasn't been sitting still. Instead, it's invested heavily in AI -- and continues to do so -- to boost its future revenue opportunities. Alphabet's large language model, Gemini, is used across its business, from improving search results and the advertising experience for advertisers to serving the customers of its cloud business.
In the recent quarter, Alphabet said demand for its AI services is growing, with cloud customers using more than eight times the compute capacity for tasks like training and inferencing than they did a year and a half ago. The company continues to increase investment in AI so that it can serve increasing demand. It announced $75 billion in capital spending for this year to support technical infrastructure such as servers, data centers, and networking.
This spending may not please investors right at this moment, but it's important to look at the situation through a long-term lens. Today's $200 billion AI market is expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade, and companies that position themselves well now are most likely to benefit. So I see Alphabet's move as a wise one from that perspective.
One element that may weigh on Alphabet is its ongoing antitrust battle. A U.S. district judge ruled last year that Alphabet has illegally used its search position to crush competition -- but the company plans to appeal, and considering past antitrust cases in the field, I'm not overly worried about the final outcome.
Now, let's get back to our question: Alphabet is the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven now. But is it a buy? I say yes. Even though the antitrust case may represent some headwinds, overall, Alphabet's leadership in its markets, its earnings track record, and its future prospects thanks to smart AI investment and innovation make me optimistic about the company -- and stock performance over the long term.

* Vietnam PM meets dozens of US companies in Hanoi

* PM cites more imports, measures to reduce trade surplus

* Vietnam fears US tariffs due to large trade imbalances

* Vietnam adopted pilot scheme in February for satellite
internet
HANOI, March 1 (Reuters) - Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham
Minh Chinh said on Saturday the government wanted to rapidly
issue a licence for Elon Musk's Starlink to provide satellite
internet in the country under a pilot scheme.
Chinh, speaking with nearly 40 U.S. businesses in Hanoi,
also said that Vietnam was taking measures to rebalance its
trade surplus with the U.S., citing potential imports of
aircraft, arms, liquefied natural gas, agriculture goods and
pharmaceutical products.
Hanoi is trying to avoid U.S. duties on its ballooning
exports, which contributed to a record trade surplus last year,
making the Southeast Asian nation vulnerable to reciprocal
tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.
""The PM has directed the Ministry of Science and Technology
to quickly issue a license to Starlink internet (services) on a
trial basis,"" the government said on its website, reporting on
the discussions Chinh had with U.S. businesses.
In February the Vietnamese parliament approved a temporary
scheme to allow satellite internet companies to provide services
in Vietnam while retaining full control on their local
subsidiary - a precondition set by Musk.
That represented a sudden shift in Vietnam's stance about
ownership of satellite internet providers, as the Communist-run
country maintains strict limits on foreign control for multiple
economic sectors it considers sensitive.
A U.S. official who attended Saturday's meeting said the
discussion ""will hopefully solve some pending issues"" for U.S.
companies in Vietnam.
Chinh is planning separate meetings with other foreign
businesses in the coming days, multiple investors told Reuters,
as he tries to quell concerns caused by global trade tensions
and the impact they could have on the export-reliant country.

IMPORT DEALS?
Among the possible measures that could reduce Vietnam's
commercial surplus with the United States are massive purchases
by Vietnamese airlines of Boeing planes, the government
said.
It cited a deal flag carrier Vietnam Airlines
struck with Boeing in 2023 during a visit to Hanoi of former
U.S. president Joe Biden for the purchase of 50 737 Max jets.
Vietnam's government reported on Saturday the deal was worth
$11 billion, without clarifying whether it included engines and
other parts usually bought separately. The White House had said
in 2023 the value was $7.8 billion.
Vietnam Airlines did not immediately reply to a request for
comment on Saturday.
The government said Vietnam was discussing possible lower
prices for the planes with Boeing and also mentioned the deal
Vietnamese low-cost airline VietJet has to buy 200
Boeing 737 MAX jets.
The deal was first signed in 2016 and revised afterwards,
but no plane has yet been delivered although the company had
said it expected to receive the first jets last year.
The government and Vietnamese officials have cited for weeks
multiple measures to address the trade surplus with the U.S. but
no major deals have yet been announced.
The government has said it could import more U.S. farm
products, and officials have repeatedly expressed interest in
buying U.S. liquefied natural gas for the country's fledgling
LNG industry.
Military deals have also been frequently discussed,
including the purchase of Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules
military transport planes.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Transportation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) stands against the other transportation stocks.
Transportation stocks are those of companies classified as industrial businesses, which range from heavy equipment manufacturers to transportation service providers.
According to the Business Research Company, the transport market has expanded significantly in recent years. It is projected to rise from $6941.93 billion in 2024 to $7522.07 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 8.4%. Economic expansion, population increase, technical improvements, and consumer behavior are all factors that contributed to historical growth. Meanwhile, the transportation sector is anticipated to boom significantly in the next few years. It will reach $9968.7 billion in 2029, with a compound annual growth rate of 7.3%. Regionally, Western Europe had the largest transport market in 2024. Asia-Pacific was the second-largest inland water transport market.
As of February 22, 2025, the broader market's transportation industry had returned 3.14% in the previous year, 5.25% in the previous five years, and 4.85% over the last ten. However, performance was negative, at 2.24% year to date and 0.80% over three years.
According to S&P Global’s report, despite a minor slowdown in GDP growth to 2.0% from 2.7% in 2024, the transportation infrastructure industry in the United States is anticipated to experience consistent demand and expansion in 2025. While volume growth in enplanements, port containers, transit ridership, and automobile traffic may moderate, most modes of transportation will continue to grow through 2027. Public transit ridership is projected to stay at 90% of pre-pandemic levels unless external factors, such as reduced remote work or congestion pricing, boost demand. Meanwhile, enplanements, port container traffic, and vehicle travel are likely to stay above pre-pandemic levels, resulting in stable financial performance for this market.
Looking forward, as per Harris William’s report, the transportation and logistics sector is expected to grow rapidly in 2025, propelled by M&A activity and economic recovery. The automotive and heavy-duty aftermarkets remain resilient due to higher maintenance demand as new car prices rise. Investors are attracted to non-discretionary services such as repairs and fleet management. Third-party logistics (3PL) is evolving with technologically advanced solutions to optimize supply chains. Transportation infrastructure services (TIS) continue to draw investment due to their critical role in maritime, rail, and road networks. Companies that provide important, high-demand solutions have growth potential, making the sector a prime target for capital deployment and innovation.
Frank Mountcastle Head of M&A Group, Head Managing Director, commented:
""The transportation and logistics industry's mix of established and emerging growth drivers will continue to attract a wide set of investors,"" ""The future is bright for businesses that embrace technology to create efficiencies and add more value while bringing specialized capabilities and a broader array of solutions to their customers.""
According to the PWC’s Transportation and Logistics: US Deals 2025 outlook, the U.S. transportation and logistics industry saw $51.5 billion in deal value across 71 announced transactions in the six months ended November 15, 2024, up from $39.5 billion and 69 agreements in the previous period. This growth shows that investor confidence is rising in line with improved profitability. The transportation and logistics (T&L) sector is seeing an increase in dealmaking due to strong economic conditions and investor confidence. Following the Federal Reserve's first rate decrease in over four years and the next administration's deregulatory agenda, M&A activity is expected to revive. While financial purchasers' participation has slowed, strategic participants are driving transactions, particularly as freight rates and profitability stabilize. Trucking consolidation, railroad logistics innovation, and technological developments in logistics are all key themes to keep an eye on. To profit on the expected market rebound, dealmakers will need agility in fundraising, talent retention, and a strong M&A playbook.
Darach Chapman, US Transportation and Logistics Deals Leader, stated:
“T&L deals activity is set to rebound, driven by demand recovery and supply rationalization. However, macro factors such as trade policy and deregulation will continue to shape M&A opportunities.”

The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is among the Best Transportation Stocks. It is a major aerospace and defense company. Its main business segments include global services, space and security, military, and commercial aircraft. Boeing's commercial jet segment competes with Airbus in the production of aircraft capable of carrying more than 130 passengers. The company's defense, space, and security division makes military aircraft, satellites, and weapons, competing with Lockheed, Northrop, and other companies. Airlines can receive aftermarket support from Global Services.
The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s significant backlog, which includes many years of production for its most popular aircraft, adds to optimism regarding the overall demand for aerospace products.
Following years of safety and manufacturing issues, Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is making headway in its recovery, notably by focusing on core industries and improving output, which is driving a significant stock rise to 2025. Its monthly 737 MAX deliveries are scheduled to grow from 17 at the end of last year to the high 30s.
Moreover, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) plans to generate positive cash flow in the second half of the year, confirming improved operational efficiency and strong product demand. Despite spending more than $14 billion, the company's cash flow may improve as a result of boosting production rates, which include building 38 aircraft every month. According to the company's half-trillion-dollar backlog and rising aircraft orders, its long-term prospects as an industrial powerhouse remain promising.
Overall BA ranks 2nd on our list of the best transportation stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for BA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing commercial airplanes head Stephanie Pope will focus on the recovery of the company's crucial and challenged plane-making unit under a reorganization that ends her role as the company's chief operating officer but leaves her as the No. 2 executive.
The move narrows the focus and responsibility of Pope. She already headed the unit making planes for airlines around the world and was the executive tasked with improving safety and raising airplane production following a series of accidents.
Pope's role as chief operating officer ended as of Feb. 19, the company said on Tuesday.
Boeing does not plan to fill the chief operating officer position, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly.
Boeing shares were barely changed in after-hours trade.
Pope was appointed to the newly created role of chief operating officer in December 2023, after then-CEO David Calhoun named her as his choice to succeed him.
After the mid-air blowout of a panel on a nearly new 737 MAX jet in January 2024, she was tapped to also run Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
The accident put renewed focus on production quality problems in the division and contributed to Calhoun's exit from the company. In August, Kelly Ortberg became Boeing's new chief executive.
Boeing's commercial airplane production has struggled through a series of crises beginning in 2019, after two fatal 737 MAX crashes revealed serious safety concerns. Historically, it has been the biggest of the company's three divisions in terms of revenue and employees.
Deliveries to customers, however, have begun to pick up. Boeing delivered 45 airplanes in January, up from 30 the previous month and the most in a month for the U.S. planemaker since 2023.
Avolon CEO Andy Cronin said this month the aircraft lessor, a major Boeing customer, was ""really encouraged by what we are seeing"" at the company after touring production facilities in Seattle in January.

Stephanie Pope is no longer serving as Boeing's chief operating officer.
She will continue to serve as president and chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the jet maker said Tuesday in a filing with a Securities and Exchange Commission. Boeing's commercial airplane division designs, assembles and sells the company's commercial aircraft, including its 737, 767 and 777 jets.
Also on Tuesday, the company said that Sabrina Soussan agreed with fellow board members to not seek reelection at the company's annual shareholder meeting in 2025.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's ANA Holdings said on Tuesday it planned to place a company-record order for up to 77 aircraft to replenish its fleet and take advantage of growing demand for travel.
The order was its largest ever in terms of aircraft numbers and was worth more than 2.1 trillion yen ($14 billion) at catalogue prices before any discounts, ANA said.
Aircraft are typically sold at roughly half their list price, aviation analysts say.
The deal includes 68 firm orders and nine options, potentially bringing the overall purchase to 30 aircraft from Boeing, 27 from Airbus, and 20 from Embraer.
The firm part of the order includes 18 GE-powered Boeing 787 wide-body jets and 15 Embraer E190-E2 regional aircraft. It also involves 27 Airbus A321neo-family narrowbodies and eight Boeing 737 MAX.
Delivery of the planes is expected between 2028 and 2033.
Growth in tourism to Japan has exploded in recent years, with annual visitors reaching record numbers. The airline said that its order reflected an expected increase in passenger demand, including from visitors to Japan.
""So looking at the growth of the overall market, we want to procure the necessary supply just as it's needed,"" Daisuke Suzuki, ANA's director of corporate strategy, told a briefing.
Suzuki said the Embraer aircraft would allow the airline to ""flexibly adjust supply to demand in our medium to long-term domestic operations.""
EMBRAER WIN
ANA's order marks a breakthrough in Japan for Brazil-based Embraer's most recent generation of E2 regional jets and a setback for Airbus, which has been trying to get a Japanese foothold for its A220.
Its current fleet does not include any aircraft from Embraer, the world's third-largest planemaker.
Embraer's focus is on up to 150-seat single-aisle aircraft, sitting just below Airbus' and Boeing's best-selling A320 and 737 narrowbody families, which carry between 150 and 240 passengers.
The deal also illustrates a turning point in Japan's efforts to promote its domestic regional aircraft industry.
ANA had ordered at least 15 of the made-in-Japan SpaceJet regional plane that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was developing, but the programme stalled in 2023 after delivery delays, in part due to difficulty obtaining necessary certifications.
ANA Holdings runs passenger and cargo carrier ANA, and low-cost airlines Peach Aviation and AirJapan. It operated 277 aircraft as of end-December and expects its fleet size to be at around 320 aircraft by the 2030 financial year.
In January, the company said it would increase the number of international flights in its 2025 fiscal year to meet growing demand, but would maintain last year's level of domestic flights.

ANA Holdings plans to buy more than $14 billion of jets from Boeing, Airbus and Embraer, partly to meet rising travel demand to Japan.
The Japanese airline on Tuesday said it decided to order up to 77 aircraft from the three companies to support medium- to long-term international growth and meet demand changes in its domestic operations. The carrier had restricted fleet renewal during the pandemic.
The planes have a total catalog price of about 2.158 trillion yen, equivalent to $14.41 billion, and are expected to be delivered by around 2033.
ANA said the group's fleet will rise to about 320 jets by around 2030.
ANA said it will order 18 Boeing 787-9s in anticipation of strong travel demand between Asia and North America. For domestic routes, it will order up to 20 Embraer E190-E2s, which the company hopes will help reduce fuel consumption. It will also order up to 39 other planes primarily to update its current fleet.
Foreign visitor arrivals to Japan rose 47% to a record 36.9 million in 2024, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization.
In March last year, Japan Airlines said it planned to buy 42 jets from Airbus and Boeing to be delivered over the next decade. Catalog prices of the 42 aircraft totaled Y1.870 trillion, according to figures provided by the company.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) has hired an adviser to explore the sale of Insitu, its defense subsidiary specializing in long-range military drones, Bloomberg News reported Monday, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with BA.
The move is part of Boeing's broader strategy to shed non-core assets and focus on its commercial and defense operations. Jefferies analysts estimate Insitu could be valued at around $500 million, with interest coming from private equity firms and corporate buyers.
Boeing acquired Insitu in 2008, and its drones, including the ScanEagle surveillance system, have been used by Ukraine's military in the war against Russia.
A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment on the potential sale.
Boeing has been seeking to boost cash flow and reduce debt, previously testing interest in selling its Orca drone submarine business before deciding to keep it, according to Bloomberg News.

The work related to this deal will be carried out in Stratford, CT.
As nations are upgrading their defense capabilities, expenditures on cutting-edge defense equipment and ammunition have been rising quickly. Increasing expenditures on military helicopters, which are essential for air combat operations, contribute to the rising defense expenditures. As a leading manufacturer of combat helicopters, Lockheed has received a steady stream of orders from all over the world.Lockheed’s unit Sikorsky Aircraft is recognized for its prowess in designing and constructing modern combat helicopters. Their specialty is in manufacturing long-lasting, high-performance rotorcraft with cutting-edge technology, assuring versatility, agility and dependability for modern military operations and missions.In particular, LMT’s CH-53K King Stallion builds on Sikorsky’s five decades of success with earlier models like the CH-53A, CH-53D/G and CH-53E. With its intelligent, dependable, low-maintenance and highly survivable design, the CH-53K is built for modern combat, including shipboard operations.
Amid rising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes, these combat-proven helicopters play a critical role in a country's security system. This is likely to have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 2.2% for the military helicopter market during the 2025-2030 period.Such a solid growth projection is expected to boost Lockheed, which holds a leading position in the military helicopter market with a portfolio that includes the Armed Black Hawk, MH-60R SEAHAWK, Raider X, S-97 Raider, S-70 BLACK Hawk and a few more helicopters. This should position the company for continued growth in the coming years.
Other defense companies that are expected to enjoy the perks of the expanding military helicopter market have been discussed below:Boeing BA: The company’s helicopters are renowned for their leading-edge, ready and relevant solutions that deliver proven capabilities. Boeing’s product portfolio includes combat helicopters and rotorcraft like the MH-139, AH-64 Apache, AH-6 Little Bird, V-22 Osprey and a few more.Boeing has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 17.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA’s 2025 sales indicates an improvement of 25.6% from the 2024 reported figure.Textron TXT: Its Bell business segment supplies advanced military helicopters and provides parts and support services to the U.S. government and military customers outside the United States. Its portfolio of combat helicopters includes Bell 412M, Bell 429M, Bell 407M and Bell 505M. TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 6.9% from the 2024 reported figure.Airbus Group EADSY: It is one of the world's largest suppliers of advanced military helicopters. EADSY’s product portfolio includes the H125M, H160M, H175M, H215M, H225M, Tiger, NH90 and a few more.The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is 9.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EADSY’s 2025 sales indicates an improvement of 3.9% from the 2024 reported figure.
In the past year, Lockheed shares have risen 2.7% against the industry’s fall of 6.2%.

The cuts add to nearly 5,100 layoffs across 11 states announced by the aircraft maker in recent months.
Boeing issued another round of layoffs at sites in two states that are set to begin in April.
The company’s Huntsville, Alabama, site will cut 71 employees starting April 18, according to the state’s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act post. The latest round adds to the 158 layoffs implemented at the Huntsville site last month.
The aircraft maker also disclosed approximately 69 job cuts in North Charleston, South Carolina, according to an email from the state’s Department of Employment and Workforce. However, an additional eight employees will be impacted, with layoffs set to begin April 5, according to the state’s WARN post. 
This makes South Carolina the second Boeing site to undergo a third round of layoffs, adding to 287 job cuts there in January and February. The notice comes two months after Boeing announced plans to spend $1 billion to expand and upgrade two 787 Dreamliner campuses in North Charleston.
The Huntsville site focuses on U.S. space and defense programs, including the Artemis space launch system program. Boeing serves as the lead contractor for NASA’s moon rocket, according to the agency’s website.
Earlier this month, Boeing informed employees working on the space launch program of approximately 400 possible job cuts as the Trump administration may cut the moon rocket program, Bloomberg reported. Elon Musk, SpaceX CEO and a senior advisor of President Donald Trump, criticized the program in a December 2024 post on X.
“[T]he Artemis architecture is extremely inefficient, as it is a jobs-maximizing program, not a results-maximizing program,” Musk wrote. “Something entirely new is needed.”
Boeing and NASA are working to finalize contract revisions on the space launch program, a company spokesperson said in an email. The rocket maker will redeploy employees where possible, but it expects to proceed with fewer than 200 involuntary layoffs in accordance with the WARN Act law.
“While Boeing is committed to supporting NASA’s Artemis missions and delivering capabilities for the core stages and Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), workforce adjustments are still necessary to drive efficiency and cost effectiveness on the program as portions of Boeing’s SLS work matures from development to production,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.
The company has mitigated the majority of its previously announced 10% workforce reduction, or an estimated 17,000 employees worldwide, the spokesperson added. The troubled aircraft titan is cutting costs to retain cash after a bruising 2024, with a $11.8 billion net loss for the full year, due largely to a 53-day labor union workers’ strike last fall and costs associated with laying off thousands of workers.
“As announced in October 2024, we continue to adjust our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and a more focused set of priorities,” Boeing said in a statement. “We are committed to ensuring our employees have support during this challenging time.”

We recently published a list of 11 Best Performing Dow Stocks So Far in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) stands against other best performing Dow stocks so far in 2025.
The Dow is a renowned and significant stock market index that measures the performance of 30 publicly traded businesses listed on US stock exchanges, representing a diverse variety of industries.
As of 20 February 2025, the index has steadily increased, rising 14.41% in the last 12 months and 4.21% year to date in 2025. It rose 8.04% over the last six months, mirroring its 8.04% gain in the previous month. Over the long term, it has risen 52.37% in the last five years and has returned an astounding 3,362.55% since 1985.
In comparison, the broader market has outpaced the Dow, gaining 22% in the last year and 4% year to date in 2025. The wider market has risen 8.84% during the last six months, with a 1.13% increase in the last month. Its long-term performance has been favorable, with a five-year gain of 83.28% and a remarkable 3,717.09% increase since 1996. Its superior performance is largely due to the strength of technology and high-growth stocks.
Nonetheless, the Nasdaq has led the market, climbing 28.12% in the last 12 months and 3.53% year to date in 2025. Over the last six months, the Nasdaq has gone up by 11.40%, with 1.04% growth in the last month. Over the last five years, it has surged by 108.45%, proving its dominance in high-growth sectors.
While the Dow has fallen behind the other two markets in recent years, its consistency and solid historical returns underline its long-term investment appeal. The index typically has reduced volatility and concentrates on established blue-chip companies.
According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dow is still a dependable benchmark for US market performance, following 30 blue-chip businesses with strong reputations and consistent growth. Its price-weighted system ensures stability, typically reducing losses during downturns. The index has a historical association with broader markets, but it is less volatile than the broader market due to its emphasis on well-established firms. Despite its small size, the index has shown resilience in bear markets, such as 2009, while also reaping gains during bullish cycles. Its longstanding reputation and exposure to important industries make it a reliable predictor of economic strength.
However, the Dow lost 0.6% on Thursday, February 20, 2025, as U.S. jobless claims surged faster than expected, heightening concerns about the labor market and the overall economic outlook. The wider market fell 0.5%, while the Nasdaq fell 0.7% in early trading, signaling broader market weakness. Investors reacted to economic data and shifting market sentiment as bond yields edged lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 4.52%.
A modern commercial jetliner in flight, its wings capturing the gleam of the sunlight.
We began with a pool of 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and identified stocks that have delivered positive returns in 2025 so far. We then picked the top 11 stocks with the highest Year-to-Date return as of February 14. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their year-to-date performance.
“Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).”
 Year-to-date return as of February 14: 7.30%
One of the Best Performing Stocks, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is a significant aerospace and defense business. Its primary business areas are global services, space and security, military, and commercial aircraft. Boeing’s commercial jets division competes with Airbus in the construction of aircraft that can accommodate more than 130 passengers. The company’s defense, space, and security branch manufactures military aircraft, satellites, and weaponry in competition with Lockheed, Northrop, and many other businesses. Airlines can get aftermarket support from Global Services.
The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)’s significant backlog, which covers several years of production for the most well-liked aircraft, adds to the assurance over the general need for aerospace products.
After years of safety and manufacturing problems, the Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is making progress in its recovery, particularly by focusing on core businesses and increasing output, which is responsible for the substantial stock rise in 2025. Its monthly 737 MAX deliveries are expected to increase from 17 at the end of last year to the high 30s.
Furthermore, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is expected to achieve positive cash flow in the second half of the year, confirming increased operational effectiveness and solid product demand. Despite spending over $14 billion, the company’s cash flow could improve as a result of increased production rates, which include making 38 aircraft every month. According to the company’s half-trillion-dollar backlog and rising airline orders, its long-term prospects as an industrial powerhouse are still bright.
Overall, BA ranks 10th on our list of Best Performing Dow Stocks So Far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential for BA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Key Points
The aerospace giant's loss may be other companies' gain, with SpaceX and Blue Origin among the prime potential beneficiaries.
""The report of my death was an exaggeration."" -- Mark Twain 
First published more than 125 years ago, the great author's quip about his rumored demise applies well to the situation today with NASA's Space Launch System (SLS), a 322-foot tall rocket designed to carry astronauts to the moon, and built by Boeing (BA -2.33%) and its partners.
I've written at least a half dozen stories, dating back as far as 2018, highlighting various political efforts to cancel the SLS program and its $82 billion worth of future NASA contracts. Just last year, for instance, the NASA Office of Inspector General called the SLS excessively expensive, while former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg lambasted it as likely unnecessary. And yet the program lives on.  
But perhaps not for much longer.
Image source: Getty Images.
About a week ago, Boeing SLS program manager David Dutcher called an all-hands meeting of the 800 or so employees working on the rocket and warned that as many as half their jobs could soon go away.
Admittedly, this is not Boeing's intention. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act requires large U.S. employers to give 60 days' notice to workers if there's a possibility the company will conduct a mass layoff. Dutcher's meeting was apparently called in response to this requirement, given the fear that the Trump administration may end Boeing's SLS contracts in March. Dutcher acted in the context of the ongoing work by the Department of Government Efficiency to cut federal spending, as well as the expected March release of the Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal, which may or may not include funding for the SLS.
However, canceling the SLS program doesn't seem to be part of NASA's plan, at least not yet. Soon after the Boeing meeting took place, NASA released a statement confirming that it sees the SLS as ""essential"" to Project Artemis. And a Bloomberg article published on Feb. 12 reported that Boeing thinks as few as 200 employees might end up getting laid off. Still, NASA couldn't assure Boeing that all its SLS project workers' jobs were safe.
""NASA defers to its industry contractors for more information regarding their workforces,"" said the space agency.  
It's hard to overstate how great the risk is here for Boeing. Ars Technica's Eric Berger estimates that NASA spends about $3 billion a year developing and keeping the SLS program going, which is equal to about $1 out of every $8 that Boeing's defense, space and security division makes. And that's not even counting the $4 billion-plus cost each time this rocket launches.
At a minimum, if the SLS program were canceled (and not replaced by other rocket programs), that would save the government more per year than the sum of all the cuts made so far by the Trump administration based on the recommendations of Elon Musk's ""Department of Government Efficiency."" (That's according to an estimate from Musk's own Grok AI, by the way).
Over the entire anticipated length of Project Artemis, with 20 missions planned, the revenues lost to Boeing and its partners could add up to $82 billion. 
So whether you're a shareholder in Boeing, which oversees the SLS program, or in Northrop Grumman (NOC -0.09%), which builds the rocket's solid rocket boosters, L3Harris (LHX -0.25%), which makes the main engines, or Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.59%), which builds the Orion space capsule that it carries, ending the SLS program would sap billions of dollars of revenue from your space stock's top line.
Image source: Getty Images.
That said, it's not all bad news for space investors. Canceling SLS wouldn't necessarily mean canceling Project Artemis. It doesn't mean America isn't going back to the moon -- just that it wouldn't be using SLS rockets to get there.
Funds originally designated to pay for fewer than two dozen SLS launches could, and likely would, be retargeted toward launches (maybe even more launches) by companies not named Boeing. Musk's SpaceX would presumably be a prime beneficiary, given that it already has NASA contracts to build two moon landers, and possesses at least one rocket (Falcon Heavy) capable of reaching the moon, as well as a second rocket (Starship) that's undergoing test flights.
Blue Origin is another likely beneficiary. Jeff Bezos' space company has already launched one New Glenn rocket with a payload to orbit capacity greater than the Falcon Heavy's. Blue Origin also has a NASA contract to produce landers for Project Artemis. And then there's Intuitive Machines (LUNR -4.62%), which is building smaller landers, as well as Rocket Lab (RKLB -4.00%) and a whole host of other small space companies that would probably love to bank some of that sweet, sweet Project Artemis money.
Not all of these companies are publicly traded. SpaceX and Blue Origin, for instance, may still be years away from their IPOs. But you can already invest in Intuitive Machines and Rocket Lab today.
Come to think of it, if the SLS gets canceled, maybe you should.
Rich Smith has positions in Rocket Lab USA. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends L3Harris Technologies. The Motley Fool recommends Lockheed Martin and Rocket Lab USA. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Key Points
There has been some interesting and mixed news flow around  Boeing (BA -2.33%) recently. While what is being reported about the aerospace giant isn't coming from official sources at the aerospace giant, the assertions still come from credible sources, and they touch on key company objectives.
To summarize the three main narratives:
All of these issues are connected to things that Boeing will need to do if it's going to convince investors that it's back on the right track. Unfortunately, the first two narratives cast some doubt on that premise.
The Air Force One program is one of four highly problematic fixed-price development programs at Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS). The others are the KC-46 refueling tanker, T-7 training aircraft, and the MQ-25 refueling drone.
While these programs only account for 15% of BDS revenue, they have generated multibillion-dollar losses and charges over the last few years. The Air Force One news is unfavorable, but if Boeing had to choose which of these four programs it was going to face delays on, it would probably be that one, because the potential longer-term demand for the other types of aircraft in development is greater.
Image source: Getty Images.
On Boeing's latest earnings call at the end of January, CFO Brian West confirmed that flight testing had resumed on the 777X and said that ""we still expect the first delivery in 2026."" Unfortunately, the commentary from someone close to the people doing the planning at Emirates offers a reason to doubt that timeline. 
The 777X is the successor to the 777, and it was initially supposed to come into service in 2020, helping to drive the next cycle of widebody airplanes. Moreover, Emirates is Boeing's key customer for the 777X, responsible for 205 of the  481 unfilled orders on the plane currently standing. Only Qatar Airways' 94 orders come anywhere near the Emirates contract. In other words, Emirates matters to Boeing and the 777X.
If 777X deliveries face further delays, it opens up the possibility that Boeing will have to make payments to airlines to compensate them for having to reorganize their fleets, schedules, and growth plans. Those delays would also hit Boeing's cash position as it would have to hold its 777X inventory for longer. And that doesn't even touch on the company's increased development and testing costs.
Image source: Boeing.
Safran is the joint-venture partner with GE Aerospace in CFM International, which is the sole provider of the LEAP engines used on the 737 MAX. GE CEO Larry Culp expects CFM to increase its LEAP production by 15% to 20% this year, and believes that target aligns with production plans at Boeing and Airbus. (The LEAP is one of two engine options for the Airbus A320 neo.)
On GE's fourth-quarter conference call, Culp wouldn't be drawn out about precisely how CFM expected to split its LEAP deliveries between Boeing and Airbus in 2025, beyond simply stating that it was ""well aligned to support both of them as they step up production this year."" However, the recent commentary from Safran's CEO was positive, and offers a reason to feel confident that Boeing will be able to ramp up 737 MAX production in line with management's plans. 
If it turns out to be true that the new Air Force One jets face additional delays, that wouldn't be a positive for Boeing, but it's unlikely that it would be hugely significant to the company's big-picture situation over the long term. However, if the 777X's first delivery date is pushed back again, Boeing is likely to face more charges, and may see some orders delayed or cancelled. That's something investors will want to keep an eye on.
On a brighter note, the delivery rate on the 737 MAX is the most crucial statistic for investors to watch. Suppose Boeing can hit a rate of 42 a month by the end of the year. In that case, investors can start penciling in more optimistic assumptions for Boeing Commercial Airplanes' profitability and cash flow. That would be a significant plus, and would enhance the stock's near-term prospects.
Lee Samaha has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends GE Aerospace. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Boeing,2025-02-22,"Atlas Air, DHL terminate Polar Air Cargo joint venture",Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d92b4e1c2074b769492fd99cea3db1d7cfeb7a198499a1deb5257ecf7562e839,"Polar Air Cargo has ceased operating after Atlas Air and DHL Express determined the joint venture was no longer useful. The post Atlas Air, DHL terminate Polar Air Cargo joint venture appeared first on FreightWaves.","Oops, something went wrong
Atlas Air and DHL Express will disband their Polar Air Cargo joint venture after 18 years. Atlas will continue to provide air transport service for its long-time commercial partner under traditional vendor arrangements, FreightWaves has confirmed.
Atlas Air is the world’s largest operator of Boeing 747 freighter aircraft. The decision to exit the Polar Air Cargo venture is consistent with Atlas Air’s new strategic focus of diversifying its customer base and concentrating on high-margin, long-haul flying.
“As we considered the evolution of our respective companies, Atlas and DHL have mutually decided that the joint venture no longer aligns with the strategic direction of either shareholder company. This decision is very much a part of our continued transformation and is in full alignment with our One Atlas Strategy,” Atlas Air said in a statement provided to FreightWaves.
Polar Air Cargo is a provider of scheduled express service and Atlas Air operates the aircraft. Most of the space is reserved for DHL, which determines the flight network. Atlas markets the rest of the capacity to freight forwarders.
New York-based Atlas Air said some operations and staff will transfer to Atlas and the others to DHL. Atlas will continue to hold Polar’s air operating certificate. No timetable for Polar’s shutdown was given, but flight tracking site Flightradar24 and other databases list no aircraft in Polar’s fleet and no recent flight activity.
Atlas Air, which operates or leases 121 Boeing aircraft of various types, will take control of four Boeing 747-8 freighters currently in service for DHL through Polar and redeploy them to other Atlas customers under long-term contracts for dedicated transport service. It will also continue as a contract carrier within DHL Express’ global air network.
DHL will take back two Boeing 777 cargo jets it contributed to the joint venture, with Atlas providing the crews, maintenance and insurance to fly them.
Last year, Polar Air Cargo had eight freighters in its fleet, according to aviation databases.
DHL Express provided a similar statement about the break up of Polar Air Cargo and the continuing partnership with Atlas Air.
Trade publication Cargo Facts broke the news Friday afternoon that Atlas and DHL were folding up their joint venture.
With new ownership behind it, Atlas Air is changing from an airline hired by other entities that pay a set rate for flight time and for guaranteed cargo space. Instead, it wants to have a direct selling relationship with customers.
Last summer, Atlas Air and Amazon ended their relationship under which Atlas provided crews for eight Boeing 737-800 narrowbody converted freighters and 17 Boeing 767-300 medium widebodies. Amazon placed the 767s with ABX Air and is in the process of transferring the 737-800s to existing partner Sun Country Airlines.
Atlas Air CEO Michael Steen said in an interview last year that Atlas Air would reallocate resources to intercontinental operations, where the potential for profits is greater.
The carrier added Chinese e-commerce platforms Shein and Temu as customers in 2024 and has aggressively pursued e-commerce business in the past couple of years.
It’s also possible that Atlas wanted to distance itself from the fraud scandal that recently engulfed Polar Air. Four former executives were sentenced last year to prison for accepting millions of dollars in kickbacks from co-conspirators who owned or operated companies that provided services to Polar Air Cargo or were customers, in exchange for ensuring the airline gave them favorable business deals.
DHL’s desire to rely on more fuel-efficient 777 freighters as part of its environmental commitment and for reliability reasons, combined with the high operating cost of 747s also played a role in the decision, industry experts familiar with the company said.
On Wednesday, Atlas Air signed a statement of intent to work closely with Worldwide Flight Services, a global airport ground handling agent owned by Singapore-based SATS Ltd., on developing an integrated ground and cargo handling model to address the unique demands of e-commerce and accommodate rising volumes of other high-value shipments. The companies said they will also collaborate on development of digital and automation solutions to provide expanded track-and-trace capability for cargo moving through their networks, as well as reducing carbon emissions.
WFS provides warehouse, freighter ramp and crew transport services for Atlas at eight major U.S. airports. The new agreement expands cooperation in Singapore and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Key Points
When it comes to space companies, layoffs aren't always bad news.
Boeing (BA -2.33%) investors got a bit of a shock last week, when word leaked out that the aerospace company's ailing defense and space division, known as BDS, is bracing for layoffs. This dedicated space business builds everything from rockets to satellites to missile defense systems, and manages NASA's gigantic Space Launch System (SLS) for the Artemis program -- and it's worried that the new Trump administration may be preparing to cancel future SLS contracts.
And the jobs of anywhere from 200 to 400 of the 800 staffers who work on SLS could be at risk.
Nor is Boeing alone in worrying about job security in the space industry. Bloomberg reported last week that one of the new space companies challenging Boeing's dominance in rocketry, Blue Origin, is also preparing to lay off a chunk of its workforce.
As Bloomberg reports, Jeff Bezos' great big space company ""is looking to cut costs and focus resources on ramping up rocket launches after years of R&D [research and development] work."" Blue Origin may be planning to release anywhere from a few hundred up to 1,000 of its 14,000 employees in the layoffs -- probably even more workers than Boeing will let go.
Blue Origin's New Glenn reusable space rocket blasted into orbit last month, successful on its first try. And while at first glance, that may sound like a strange catalyst for layoffs, it's actually not the first time we've seen something like this happen in the space industry.
In November 2023, Sierra Space (another space company that may have ambitions to go public) conducted a similar pivot. With development of its Dream Chaser spaceplane completed, Sierra announced it would lay off 165 R&D workers, and replace them by hiring 150 new workers possessing security clearances, to work on missions flying Dream Chaser. Looked at this way, what Sierra Space was doing was more right-sizing and aligning its workforce to the task at hand, than laying off workers just to cut costs.
Image source: Blue Origin.
Blue Origin may be planning something similar, as it works ""to ramp up New Glenn flights and clear some $10 billion worth of launch contracts"" it has in backlog, says Bloomberg. Reporting from The Wall Street Journal supports this interpretation.
As CEO Dave Limp wrote to employees: ""Our primary focus in 2025 and beyond is to scale our manufacturing output and launch cadence."" And that entails cutting ""bureaucracy"" and ""management,"" especially in the company's ""engineering, R&D, and program/project management"" departments.
Cost-cutting is certainly one goal of this exercise. At the December 2024 New York Times DealBook Summit, founder Bezos warned that Blue Origin is ""not a very good business yet"" (that is, it's losing money), although he thinks that given time, it could eventually become ""the best business I've been involved in.""
Image source: Blue Origin.
Coming from the guy who founded Amazon.com, the fifth-biggest company in America according to Motley Fool data, that's a bold prediction. Cutting costs at the same time Blue Origin converts $10 billion in backlog into revenue and profit should help to make it a reality.
What remains to be seen is whether Blue Origin will also take the next step, as Sierra Space did: expand hiring in departments that manufacture New Glenn rockets, and manage their launching and operations in space. Personally, I expect that's exactly what we'll see.
Consider the following scenario: Working from a known $10 billion backlog, and a presumed launch cost of $100 million per rocket, Blue Origin may have up to 100 future launches currently on its manifest. Now assume the company follows a standard growth curve for space companies, roughly doubling its launch cadence every year. Starting with one launch in January, and perhaps two total this year, it grows to four launches in 2026, eight in 2027, and so on. I'd say Blue Origin probably has about five to six years' worth of launches ahead, before counting any new contracts it wins in the future.
So aside from increasing the chance we'll one day be able to buy into a Blue Origin IPO, what does this imply for investors? As its motto promises (gradatim ferociter -- ""step by step, ferociously""), Blue Origin is starting off slow with its New Glenn launches, but it will accelerate at quite a clip. Pressure on incumbent heavy-lift rocket companies like Arianespace (in Europe), SpaceX, and United Launch Alliance (that's Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.59%) and...the now-downsizing Boeing) is going to grow steadily over the next few years.
Precisely how bad that will be for their businesses will depend on how ""ferociously"" Jeff Bezos decides to compete on pricing. Stay tuned as we learn more about how much Blue Origin will charge for rides on its new megarocket.

Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently won a contract to upgrade the baseline weapon systems of a handful of missiles by providing engineering services, technological demonstrations, and design and development studies. These missiles included in the contract are Hellfire, Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, Joint Air to Ground Missile and Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile.
Valued at $99.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by February 2030. The work related to this contract will be executed in Orlando, FL. The deal has been given by the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA.The deal also includes offering assistance for integrating the aforementioned armaments into tactical aircraft platforms for the U.S. Navy.
Rapidly increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide and heightened regional conflicts in different parts of the globe have prompted nations to bolster their defense capabilities over the last decade. Since missiles constitute a large share of a nation’s defense arsenals, countries are investing heftily in advanced missile systems for deterrence and defense.This is likely to have led the Mordor Intelligence firm to predict that the global missile and missile defense systems market will witness a CAGR of 5% during the 2025-2030 period. Such growth opportunities offered by the missile and missile defense systems market should bode well for Lockheed Martin, with its product portfolio consisting of numerous combat-proven missiles and missile systems.This defense contractor’s Missiles and Fire Control unit is a recognized developer of high-performance missiles. The unit pursues business in more than 50 nations globally. Some of its major products are the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, Spike NLOS, Guided MLRS and Precision Strike Missile.
Other defense companies that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding global missile and missile defense systems market have been discussed below:The Boeing Company BA: For almost 25 years, the company has been providing air and missile defense systems to the United States, its allies and international partners. Its offerings include the Avenger Air Defense System, Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Ground-Based Midcourse Defense.Boeing boasts a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 17.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA’s 2025 sales implies growth of 25.6% from the 2024 reported figure.Northrop Grumman NOC: The company provides high-speed, long-range strike weapons like the AARGM-ER, which is a supersonic, air-launched tactical missile system. It also develops and manufactures warheads, fuses, advanced high-speed propulsion systems and other missile components.Northrop has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2025 sales suggests growth of 3.2% from the prior-year reported figure.RTX Corporation RTX: It is known for its missile defense systems, such as the Patriot and SM-6, which are in high demand globally. The company also has a handful of combat-proven missiles in its product portfolio, such as the TOW missile, Guidance Enhanced Missile, the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, Tomahawk and Standard Missile 2.The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is 9.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX’s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 4.4% from the 2024 reported figure.

            Boeing has had six years of production problems, safety issues, delivery delays and unhappy buyers of its aircraft. But President Donald Trump’s anger at the delays for the next generation of Air Force One jets could result in a huge blow to what remains of the company’s prestige and finances going forward.
    

            The rift between Trump and Boeing could a be a serious problem for Boeing under a presidential administration that is looking to make massive government spending cuts, lawsuits and Congress notwithstanding.
    

            The company gets 42% of its revenue from US government contracts, according to its most recent filing. In 2022 Boeing moved its corporate headquarters from Chicago to the Washington, DC, suburb of Arlington, Virginia, close to the Pentagon, an indication of how it views the importance of its defense business. But that business is far more at risk than even its troubled commercial plane business.
    

            Trump has groused for days about the wait for the next generation of Boeing 747 jets that are supposed to serve as the primary presidential air transport, officially known as the VC-25B but flying under the name Air Force One when the president is onboard. The jets currently flying under the Air Force One moniker have been in service since the George H.W. Bush administration. The new planes were supposed to be delivered in 2024 when the contracts were originally awarded in 2018, but are still years away from completion according to the latest estimates.
    

            The president said earlier this week he’s interested in possibly looking to buy used jets elsewhere and refurbishing them. It would be a similar move to one he made early in his first term, after he ordered the US Air Force to re-negotiate the Air Force One contract with Boeing. Boeing has been working on refurbishing two 747 jets that had been originally built for commercial use ever since.
    

            “I’m not happy with the fact that it’s taken so long,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One Wednesday evening. “There’s no excuse for it.”
    

            He said Wednesday on Air Force One that he wouldn’t consider using a jet made by Boeing’s European competitor Airbus but that, “I could buy one that was used and convert it…. So we’re looking at other alternatives.” 


            Trump’s anger at Boeing over the Air Force One delays might be translating into further worries for the company’s larger defense business, according to Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace consulting firm.
    

            While Boeing has been a major supplier of military drones in the past, the Pentagon’s most recent drone contracts went to competitors. “Boeing was conspicuously absent,” Aboulafia said.
    

            And Boeing, with its reliance on military procurement for its balance sheet, is vulnerable to spending cuts. Despite Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth calling for increased defense spending just a week ago, the Trump administration issued a memo Wednesday ordering the military to cut 8% from its budget each year for the next five years.
    

            Boeing could thus be an easy target for an administration that is already upset over a major project of great personal interest to Trump, as well as one that has put Elon Musk – no fan of crewed jets like the F-15 built by Boeing for the US Air Force – in charge of those spending cuts.
    

            “It would be extremely easy to cancel the F-15 program and buy more of something else or divert the cash to other needs,” said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace consulting firm. He said the military has already indicated a desire to use more drones and fewer piloted aircraft.
    

            Boeing’s space business has been a huge disappointment as well, where it is a major competitor to SpaceX, owned and run by Musk.
    

            SpaceX has been delivering astronauts and supplies to space for NASA for years. By comparison Boeing’s Starliner rocket was years behind plans for its first crewed mission to take astronauts to the International Space Station. When that flight took place last year, problems with the spacecraft forced NASA to have it return to earth without anyone on board, leaving the two astronauts stranded at the ISS. They will soon return home on in a SpaceX Dragon capsule.
    

            Despite Trump’s talk about finding an alternative to provide the next Air Force One jets, the problem is not the basic jet, but what it takes to turn a run-of-the-mill Boeing 747 into the flying communications and command post fit for the President of the United States known as Air Force One, Aboulafia said.
    

            “You can have a jet anytime,” he said. “But it takes a great deal of work to have encrypted communications and managed the military and federal government from anywhere around the world in any circumstance.”
    

            And the jet has been further delayed by a pandemic that came after Boeing agreed to the original contract.
    

            Trump negotiated a $4 billion deal for two new jets with Boeing in 2018. But it has been a disaster for Boeing.
    

            It was a fixed-priced contract, meaning that Boeing had to absorb any costs that went over what the government was initially willing to pay. Through the end of last year Boeing has reported $2.5 billion in losses on the contract with no end or firm delivery date in sight.
    

            In comments Thursday, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said he is “all in” on trying to speed up the delivery and praised suggestions made by Musk, who visited the Texas facility where the work is being done in December on Trump’s behalf, before he formally started in his role as head of the  Department of Government Efficiency.
    

            “The president is clearly not happy with the delivery timing,” Ortberg said at an investors conference. “He’s made that well known. Elon Musk is actually helping us a lot in working through the requirements… to try to help us get the things that are non value-added constraints out of the way, so we can move faster and the president those airplanes.”
    

            Part of the losses can probably be attributed to Boeing agreeing to take far less money than it originally negotiated on the contract during the Obama administration before Trump took office, which was about $5.3 billion. But Trump had started questioning the cost of the contract in December 2016, after his election but before his inauguration.
    

            “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” he tweeted at the time.
    

            Agreeing to a steep discount to that original price was likely an easy decision for Boeing to make in 2018, when money was flowing into the company at record levels. The company reported $100 billion in revenue for the first time in 2018, and $10.7 billion in operating profit. And it was projecting both revenue and profits would increase further in 2019.
    

            But the financial situation turned bad for the company very quickly after it agreed to the Air Force One deal. Supply chain problems slowed the renovation process, and during the pandemic Boeing had a shortage of the workers with the needed security clearance to work on the plane. Workers need security clearance equivalent to that of people who work at the White House.
    

            Former CEO Dave Calhoun admitted in 2022 comments to investors that “Boeing probably shouldn’t have taken” the risks of the contract during what he called “a very unique negotiation.”
    

            But with Trump threatening to cancel the contract, and with nearly a third of the company’s revenue at the time coming from federal government contracts, Boeing felt it had to agree to the contract for the high profile, high prestige planes.
    

            The original cost and time estimates to produce the two planes were due to the complexity and safety features. They are supposed to be able to fly and protect its occupants from missile attack or even the shock waves of nuclear blast, while still giving the president a flying command post in the case of such an emergency.
    

            Boeing took two of the largest version of its 747 jets that it had already built and started a massive renovation to provide it with the protections needed, but the requirements of Air Force One necessitated what essentially was a complete rebuild anyway.
    

            As bad as the losses on the planes have been, they are only a sliver of the $51.1 billion in core operating losses it has rung up since two fatal crashes of its 737 jets led to a 20-month grounding of its best-selling plane starting in 2019. But it’s not only the commercial plane unit that is losing money. Operating losses from its defense, space and security business soared to $5.4 billion last year and have not posted a profit since 2021.
    

            Boeing’s current rocky relations with the Trump administration don’t suggest that will improve anytime soon.

MIAMI (Reuters) -Supply chains for major planemakers Boeing and Airbus are showing signs of moderate improvement, the chief executive of Saudi start-up Riyadh Air said on Thursday.
Securing adequate parts, for both new and existing planes, has been a major problem for the airline industry in recent years. The causes ranged from general disruption emanating from the COVID-19 pandemic to industrial action at Boeing which caused a seven-week halt to most jet production last fall.
""Are there big challenges out there - yes there definitely are. Is the supply chain stretched and under huge stress - yes, and yes,"" Tony Douglas told an FII Institute event in Miami.
""But am I seeing signs of moderate improvement - I honestly have to say, yes I do.""
Douglas said one continued bottleneck was the suppliers that serve both Boeing and Airbus, which he described as being ""one level down"". He said Riyadh Air was working to overcome any challenges, without adding further details.
Backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, Riyadh Air has been ordering planes from both manufacturers ahead of its launch. This includes 60 narrow-body A321-family jets from Airbus in October, as well as up to 72 Boeing 787 Dreamliners ordered in March 2023.
The airline is currently engaged in a process to select extra wide-body jets, Douglas said, without elaborating further.
Douglas told Reuters in October it was planning to talk to Airbus about A350-1000 aircraft and Boeing on its 777X jets.
Riyadh Air is expected to start operations by the end of the year, Douglas told the event. In the October interview, Douglas had guided that it would begin flights in the second half of this year.

STORY: :: Trump says he's not happy
with Boeing's Air Force One delays
:: February 19, 2025
""No, I'm not happy with Boeing. It takes them a long time to do, you know, Air Force One, we gave that contract out a long time ago. It's a fixed price contract. And I'm not happy with the fact that it's taking so long. We may do something else. We may buy a plane or get a plane, or something. But I'm not happy with the fact that it's taken so long, there's no excuse for it. // No, I would not consider Airbus over Boeing, but I could buy one that was used and convert it. I could buy one from another country, perhaps, or get one from another country. So we're looking at other alternatives, cause it's taking Boeing too long.""
Trump's comments were the latest attempt to ratchet up pressure on Boeing, which is at least three years behind schedule in delivering two new Air Force One jets.
Boeing is getting help from Tesla CEO Elon Musk to get through the requirements of the long-delayed Air Force One program, following complaints from U.S. President Donald Trump, the planemaker's CEO Kelly Ortberg said on Thursday.
Ortberg said the supply chain for the 737 MAX is in good shape as the U.S. planemaker aims to grow output of the model to 38 a month by mid-2025. However, Boeing's supply chain team is working to assess the impact of a fire that hit a U.S. fastener producer this month.",Neutral,59.29

Pegasus Airlines has signed a new order agreement with Boeing for 200 aircraft to further strengthen its fleet in line with its growth targets. The aircraft deliveries from the new order are scheduled to join the Pegasus fleet starting from 2028. This marks the largest order ever placed in the airline's history.
Pegasus Airlines, the airline with the youngest fleet in Turkiye, and one of the youngest in the world, continues to expand its fleet with next-generation aircraft, and has made a significant investment in line with its goal of becoming a leading global player. Following extensive evaluations regarding aircraft requirements for 2028 and the following decade, Pegasus has signed an agreement with The Boeing Company for 200 Boeing 737-10 aircraft. Under the terms of the agreement, Pegasus has placed a firm order for the first 100 Boeing 737-10 aircraft for delivery from 2028, with 100 additional purchasing options, which can be converted into firm orders in the future. The total value of the contract for 200 Boeing 737-10 aircraft is approximately 36 billion USD, based on Boeing's publicly announced current list prices.
The largest order in Pegasus' history not only supports the company's growth objectives, but also serves as an important step towards achieving its 2050 sustainability goals. This aircraft order signed with Boeing is a testament to the strong and significant collaboration already existing between the parties in the aviation sector. This agreement represents an important step towards establishing new partnerships and strengthening existing ones, both domestically and internationally.
In a statement made regarding the signed agreement, Guliz Ozturk, CEO of Pegasus Airlines, said: 'As a leading stakeholder in our country's tourism sector, which creates net cash inflows and the highest added value for our country, and has shown record-breaking growth after the pandemic; we are working tirelessly to reach new record-highs and do our part for Turkiye to achieve the targeted 100 million visitors and 100 billion USD in revenue in tourism. We continue to invest in our fleet in line with our growth targets in Turkiye and globally, and to expand our network by launching new routes. Currently, with an average age of 4.5 years, we have the youngest fleet in Turkiye and rank among the airlines with the youngest fleets in the world. Within the scope of our agreement with Boeing, we have ordered a total of 200 Boeing 737-10 aircraft. The first 100 aircraft, for which we have placed firm orders, will begin joining our fleet starting in 2028. We will evaluate converting the remaining 100 aircraft options into firm orders in the coming years, based on market conditions and the needs of our fleet. Boeing aircraft have been an integral part of our operations since Pegasus entered the aviation industry in 1990. We are pleased to be expanding our fleet with the new Boeing 737-10 model aircraft. We are confident that our collaboration will create new opportunities for local manufacturing, technology transfer, R&D, training, and employment in the Turkish aviation industry. When considered within the scope of Boeing's National Aerospace Initiative launched with the Turkish government in 2017, our order will also open new doors and create production and export opportunities both for Turkish manufacturers and for the wider aviation industry.'
An important step towards efficiency and sustainability
The Boeing 737-10, the largest single-aisle aircraft in Boeing's 737 MAX family, offers high efficiency for short- and medium-haul flights. Powered by CFM International LEAP-1B engines, the Boeing 737-10 stands out with 20% lower fuel consumption compared to previous-generation aircraft. With a seat capacity of up to 230 passengers, the Boeing 737-10 also offers a more comfortable travel experience due to its spacious cabin and large overhead luggage compartments.

Ortberg told analysts and investors at the Barclays Industrial Select Conference that he doesn't see any supply chain constraints right now that are going to stop the planemaker from ramping up here to the 38 a month.

(Reuters) -     A large fire broke out at a Pennsylvania factory that makes fasteners for aircraft, but no injuries were reported, authorities said on Tuesday.
The fire was reported at a commercial building of SPS Technologies in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, according to the police.
The Abington Township Police Department said there was an explosion within the building and flames could be seen inside the warehouse structure, citing statements from witnesses.
SPS Technologies, which is part of Berkshire Hathaway-owned Precision Castparts, makes fasteners and other parts for the aerospace and automotive industries, according to its LinkedIn page.
One industry source said the fire is significant for the aerospace supply chain because SPS is an important producer of fasteners for aircraft, including Boeing's 787. Supply chain challenges have weighed on efforts by Boeing and rival Airbus to ramp up plane production to meet strong airline demand.
Precision Castparts did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for a comment. Boeing and Airbus said they are in touch with the supplier after the fire.
""We're heartened to hear that no injuries are reported in the fire in Pennsylvania,"" said Joe Buccino, a spokesperson for aerostructures giant Spirit AeroSystems. ""We do not anticipate immediate disruption to Spirit's operations.""
Police said a shelter-in-place order was in effect for nearby areas.

Recent release “Desperate Measures” from Page Publishing author R. Douglas Marley is a gripping thriller that follows Mick, a pilot, who ends up putting his skills to use smuggling drugs for a cartel. However, when he’s asked to make a delivery of young girls into sex trafficking, he refuses and must find a way to save them while also avoiding the wrath of the cartel bosses.
Casa Grande, AZ February 03, 2025 --(PR.com)-- R. Douglas Marley, a native of Southern Idaho who worked as a mechanic for the Boeing Company for twenty-seven years following his service in the Air Force, has completed his new book, “Desperate Measures”: a riveting novel that centers around a pilot who, after making drug runs for a cartel, refuses to make a delivery of girls for them, thus forcing him to fend for his life against the cartel boss’s revenge.

“A skilled Pilot, Mick finds himself in the service of the Cartel, smuggling drugs,” writes Marley. “Delivering drugs is lucrative and he rationalizes his involvement, but when he is asked to deliver a group of girls into prostitution his morals kick in. How is he going to avoid making this delivery? And, if he does thwart the delivery, how will he ever escape the wrath of the Cartel? Every survival skill he has ever learned would be needed to make this work, but would they be enough?”

Published by Page Publishing, R. Douglas Marley’s enthralling tale will transport readers as they follow along on Mick’s compelling saga to protect himself from the extended reach of the cartel, who’s power and thirst for revenge seem to have no limits. Expertly paced and full of suspense, “Desperate Measures” is sure to keep the pages turning, leaving readers spellbound right up until the epic conclusion.

Readers who wish to experience this mesmerizing work can purchase “Desperate Measures” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes Store, Amazon, Google Play, or Barnes and Noble.

African airline receives first of four 787 Dreamliner airplanes on order 787 Dreamliner to expand TAAG Angola Airlines' network in Europe and open new opportunities in Asia and North America
Boeing [NYSE: BA] (www.Boeing.com) delivered the first of four 787 Dreamliner airplanes to TAAG Angola Airlines, debuting the airline's new livery. The 787-9 and subsequent deliveries of the fuel-efficient widebody jet will advance the airline's fleet modernization plans and long-haul capabilities, bringing more travelers and trade to Angola with the industry's most advanced commercial airplane.
The airline's first 787 Dreamliner, which is on lease from AerCap, arrived in Luanda just ahead of Angola's Liberation Day on February 4, marking nearly 50 years since the delivery of TAAG Angola's first airplane, a Boeing 737-200.
""The delivery of the 787-9 is a pivotal step in our strategy to modernize TAAG Angola Airlines' fleet,"" said Nelson Pedro Rodrigues de Oliveira, CEO of TAAG Angola Airlines. ""This airplane brings the efficiency and versatility we need to meet growing market demands, replace our aging widebody fleet, and deliver a world-class experience to our passengers.""
TAAG Angola Airlines currently operates five 777-300ER (Extended Range) airplanes, three 777-200ERs, and seven Next-Generation 737s, connecting Angola to 12 destinations across Africa, Europe, South America and China. The introduction of the 787 Dreamliner will enable the carrier to expand its long-haul network, with plans to launch new routes to Europe and explore opportunities in Asia and North America.
""The 787 Dreamliner will complement TAAG Angola Airlines' fleet of Boeing 737 and 777 jets, as we continue to support the airline in its mission to connect people and places across the globe,"" said Anbessie Yitbarek, vice president of Boeing Commercial Sales for Africa. ""Our 50-year relationship with TAAG Angola Airlines has been built on trust and shared goals, and we look forward to many more years of successful collaboration and innovation together.""
The 787 Dreamliner, which TAAG Angola Airlines ordered in 2023 (https://apo-opa.co/4hEsiLC), is a core part of the operator's modernization efforts. Recognized for its advanced technologies, fuel efficiency, and exceptional passenger experience, the 787 Dreamliner reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 25% compared to the airplanes it will replace.
Coinciding with the delivery of TAAG Angola Airlines' first 787 Dreamliner, the airline is working with Boeing to purchase CO2 emissions reduction associated with blended Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through an accounting process called book-and-claim. Distributors will deliver the blended SAF made available through these purchased certificates to nearby airports for use by airlines and other carriers.
Boeing's Commercial Market Outlook projects Africa will need 1,170 airplanes over the next two decades. Boeing airplanes have formed the backbone of Africa's commercial fleet for over 75 years. More than 60 airlines operate around 500 Boeing airplanes throughout Africa, which represents nearly 70% of the airplane market across the continent.

Before I get into the fourth quarter earnings, let me first offer our thoughts and deepest condolences for the families and loved ones of those on board Jeju Air Flight 2216. We continue to support the airline and the US National Transportation Safety Board, as they assist the South Korean authorities in the accident investigation.
Now, turning to the fourth quarter earnings. During the last call, I highlighted four areas critical to our recovery. And as the new year begins, we're making steady progress in all four areas. The first area, stabilizing the business. Following the resolution of the IAM strike, our commercial team has been executing a methodical plan to restart our factories within the framework of our safety management system. This included ensuring all manufacturing employees were current on their training and certifications prior to returning to work on the factory floor. We took time to rebalance the production line, so that when we started up, we did so with a healthy production system.
People are back to work and excited about the task ahead, and you can see the energy when you're on the factory floor. For the 737 MAX, we have sufficient parts inventory to enable producing at 38 a month, including fuselages, which were a pacing item prior to the strike. And all three of the production lines in Renton are now cycling. In the past quarter, we completed our safety management meeting with the FAA in which they reviewed our safety management system and our production status, including spending time on the factory floor.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call
28-Jan-2025
They reported that they saw significant improvements, and I'm pleased that we have an agreed upon path for rate increases beyond 38 per month. It's all about adhering to our safety management system and a stable factory, as measured through agreed upon key performance indicators, or KPIs. It's an early innings on the production ramp, and we need to stay disciplined on maintaining a stable production system. But early signs are encouraging. The best news is that our customers are reporting that they are encouraged with what they are seeing, as they monitor our production.
Progress on the 787 also continues, and we finished last year at a production rate of five per month. Like the 737, we are working to ensure the 787 production system, including the supply chain, is stable prior to making the next rate increase. An important accomplishment to stabilize the business was to shore up our balance sheet. We are committed to recovering the business, while maintaining an investment grade credit rating and delivering for our shareholders. I think the demand for our offering last year speaks volumes about the market's confidence in our recovery.
We're working across the supply chain, including the sub-tiers, to ensure readiness and stability with our production rates. Notably, supplier part across all of our commercial programs are within their established control limits. We have instituted dedicated sessions with suppliers to provide insights, as well as to promote two-way communication to stay aligned, as we operate together as one extended production system.
The second element of our recovery is the improved performance on our development programs. While the charges for the quarter in BDS are disappointing, I have had the opportunity to complete deep dive EAC reviews on all the troubled programs. We are very focused on creating stability within the EACs, so we stop this quarterly drumbeat of cost growth. This means being more proactive and clear-eyed on the risks and our estimates to complete the projects. While I know it doesn't show in this past quarter's performance, we're making progress in working with our customers to actively manage the contracts to achieve better outcomes for both parties.
You've seen that we've entered into an MOA with the US Air Force on the T-7A program. We're also in active discussions with our customer on the VC-25B program to make the necessary changes to improve the program performance and delivery. The US Air Force has turned this as an active management, which is a term I really like. We're focused on actively managing all of our problematic programs to improve the performance for the company and our customers.
While I said there's no silver bullet on these fixed price programs, I do feel better about our ability to better manage the performance in 2025. On the commercial side, we continue to focus on getting the 737-7 and 737-10, as well as the 777X through certification. There are no updates to the timelines we previously communicated on these programs.
On the 737-7 and 737-10, we're still working through the testing phase, focused on finalizing the icing design solution, which we plan to include in the certification program. Working closely with the FAA, especially in light of their leadership changes, will be a key focus area for us this year. The 777X is back in flight test, and we have a good handle on fixing the thrust link issue we uncovered.
Now, moving to the third area, culture change. This will be a multiyear journey, but we're already making progress. Our leaders are getting more engaged with their teams and customers. We're having the frank discussions about what we need to change. In 2025, we'll be rebaselining our core values and behaviors to make our expectations perfectly clear to all our Boeing teammates. These will be incorporated into our leadership development program and become fundamental elements of our performance management system.

Leadership promotions will be grounded not only in what we get done, but how we get things done. We're going to help focus the teams on what it takes to make Boeing successful and promote a culture of unity and accountability by implementing a single enterprise score for all of our annual incentive plans.
As I talk with employees, there's a growing swell of excitement around restoring trust and getting their Boeing back, and they want to be a part of this turnaround. So the last area is building a new future for Boeing. While workforce reductions are always difficult, I'm pleased that we have been able to reduce layers of management and redundant overheads in our system. This will serve us well, as we establish a less bureaucratic, more focused and agile operating environment for our future. We're preparing for the road ahead by continuing to make important investments in our core business, while streamlining our portfolio in areas that aren't core to us.
So, let me wrap up by saying that the markets we serve are robust and growing. Demand for our core commercial and defense products and services remain strong. Our backlog of more than $0.5 trillion clearly demonstrates the value of our portfolio, and we're focused on meeting our commitments and delivering safe, high-quality products to our customers. I do want to acknowledge and thank the incredibly talented employees at Boeing. Your resiliency and commitment gives me confidence in our path forward. It's going to take all of us working together.
Next, let me turn it over to Brian to cover the operating results. And after that, we'll be happy to take your questions. So, Brian, over to you.

Brian J. West
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.
Thanks, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $15.2 billion, down 31%, primarily driven by lower commercial deliveries associated with the IAM work stoppage. The core loss per share was $5.90, primarily reflecting previously announced impacts of the IAM work stoppage and agreement, charges on certain defense programs, as well as costs associated with workforce reductions announced last year.
Free cash flow was a usage of $4.1 billion in the quarter, in line with the expectations shared at our last earnings call. Results were impacted by lower commercial deliveries and unfavorable working capital timing, primarily driven by the IAM work stoppage.
Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing Commercial Airplanes. BCA delivered 57 airplanes in the quarter. Revenue was $4.8 billion, and operating margin was minus 43.9%, primarily reflecting previously announced impacts from the IAM work stoppage and agreement, including pre-tax charges of $1.1 billion on the 777X and 767 programs. Backlog in the quarter ended at $435 billion and includes more than 5,500 airplanes.
Now, I'll give more color on the key programs. The 737 program delivered 36 airplanes in 4Q, including a step-up to 18 airplanes in December. And as of yesterday, we've delivered 33 airplanes in January with four days to go.
On production, we restarted the factory in December and plan to gradually increase rate. We expect to be in a position to go above 38 airplanes per month later in the year. All three lines in our Renton factory [ph] are cycling (00:12:30) and monthly production is already in the low to mid-20s for January. More broadly on the master schedule, we continue to make adjustments as needed and manage supplier by supplier based on inventory levels.
Over the past year, our buffer inventory has grown to promote stability across our production system. As production stabilizes and rates increase over time, we plan to deliberately return buffer inventory to more normal

levels. The quarter ended with 55 737-8s built prior to 2023, the majority for customers in China and India, down 5 737-8s from 3Q, with about another 10 737-8s already delivered in January.
Given the impact of the strike, we now expect to shut down the shadow factory mid-year and deliver all remaining airplanes to customers within the year.
On the 737-7 and 737-10, inventory levels were stable at approximately 35 airplanes and testing on the anti-icing design solution is ongoing with certification expected to follow later in the year.
On the 787 program, we delivered 15 airplanes in the quarter, as we made progress on working through production recovery plans for heat exchangers and delivery delays associated with seat certifications. The program exited the year at a production rate of five airplanes per month and [ph] we (00:13:59) recently announced plans to expand South Carolina operations, as we prepared for anticipated future need of the commercial market. We are intent on ensuring the production system and the supply chain demonstrate stability prior to making the next increase on rates sometime this year.
We ended the quarter with 25 airplanes in inventory built prior to 2023 that require rework, down five airplanes from last quarter. Our ability to finish the rework and shut down the shadow factory was also impacted by the work stoppage and we expect to complete this work in early 2025.
Finally, on 777X, as previously announced, the $900 million pre-tax charge, primarily reflects higher estimated labor costs associated with finalizing the IAM agreement and will be incurred over the next several years. Flight testing recently resumed, and we still expect first delivery in 2026, and we'll continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we move through certification.
777X inventory spend in 2024 finished at $2.6 billion, as 4Q spending levels moderated due to the work stoppage. As noted previously, we expect the cash profile to look similar to prior development programs with the first year prior to first delivery, typically the largest use of cash driven by inventory build associated with the production ramp, which will unwind as deliveries accelerate.
Moving on to the next page in Boeing Defense & Space. BDS booked $8 billion in orders during the quarter, including awards for 15 KC-46A Tankers from the US Air Force and seven P-8A aircraft for the US Navy, and the backlog ended at $64 billion.
Revenue was $5.4 billion, down 20% year-over-year on volume and program charges, and operating margin was minus 41.9%. BDS delivered 34 aircraft and two satellites in the quarter, including the final T-7A EMD aircraft to the US Air Force. The 15% of the portfolio comprised of fixed price development programs recorded a $1.7 billion pre-tax charge as previously announced. The fixed price development cost pressures were driven by the KC-46A and T-7A programs, with KC-46 primarily reflecting higher estimated manufacturing costs, including the impacts of the IAM work stoppage and agreement and T-7A driven by higher estimated production costs on contracts in
2026 and beyond. Roughly one-third of these new charges will work through the cash flows in the next few years with the remainder spread over the coming decade.
Given the fixed price nature of these contracts, we'll continue to be transparent about impacts as we work to stabilize and mature these programs. We acknowledge that these are disappointing results. These are complicated development programs, and we remain focused on retiring risk each quarter and ultimately delivering these mission-critical capabilities to our customers.

As Kelly shared, we continue to make progress in 4Q, including key order and delivery milestones already noted. Importantly, the updated acquisition approach for the T-7A is a proof point for how we are working with our customers to find better overall outcomes for both parties, and those efforts will continue as we work through other parts of the portfolio.
On the 25% of portfolio, primarily comprised of fighter and satellite programs. Our fighter programs again recognized losses in 4Q due to disruptions associated with the F-15EX ramp-up and the F-18 production wind- down. We also recognized impacts across satellites and a few other legacy platforms tied to development realities as we work to refresh the capabilities of these platforms to support our customer needs.
The remaining 60% of revenues of the portfolio are generally performing in the mid to high-single-digit margin range, although the P8 commercial derivative program experienced margin compression in the fourth quarter due to the IAM work stoppage and agreement. While still more work in front of us, we continue to be confident that BDS margins can improve to high-single-digit levels in the medium to longer term.
The demand for our defense products remains very strong, supported by the threat environment confronting our nation and our allies. We still expect the business to return to historical performance levels as we stabilize production, execute on development programs and transition to new contracts with tighter underwriting standards.
Moving on to the next page, Boeing Global Services. BGS continued to perform well, delivering record operating margins in the quarter. The business received $6 billion in orders and the backlog ended at $21 billion. Revenue was $5.1 billion, up 6%, primarily on higher commercial volume. Operating margin was a record 19.5% in the quarter, up 210 basis points compared to last year with both our commercial and government businesses delivering double-digit margins.
In the quarter, BGS secured awards for C-17 sustainment, as well as a contract for F-15 Japan Super Interceptor upgrade and services from the US Air Force. BGS is a terrific long-term franchise focused on profitable, capital efficient service offerings and executing well with mid-single-digit revenue growth, mid-teen margins and very high cash flow conversion.
Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $26.3 billion, primarily reflecting the successful $24 billion capital raise in October, partially offset by the free cash flow usage and debt repayment. The debt balance ended at $53.9 billion, down $3.8 billion in the quarter, driven by the early repayment of a $3.5 billion bond originally set to mature in 2025.
Importantly, this prepayment derisks our 2025 maturity profile, resulting in $800 million of debt maturities remaining in the year. The company maintains access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn.
We remain committed to managing the balance sheet in a prudent manner with two main objectives; first, continue to prioritize the investment-grade rating; and second, allow the factory and supply chain reset. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to further supplement the balance sheet as we make certain portfolio decisions through the course of the year.
Turning to the next page, I'll cover the total financial company results for the full year. Full year revenue was $66.5 billion, down 14% year-over-year, driven by lower commercial deliveries, including impacts of the IAM work stoppage.

The core loss per share was $20.38, down from prior year, primarily on lower deliveries and commercial and defense program charges, including impacts of the IAM work stoppage and agreement.
Free cash flow was $14.3 billion usage for the year, down versus prior year on commercial deliveries and unfavorable working capital timing, including the impact of the work stoppage.
Stepping back, let me provide some additional context on 2025 free cash flow. 2025 will be an important year in our recovery. And while we still expect it to be a use of cash, we anticipate a significant improvement over 2024.
Within 2025, we expect 1Q free cash flow will be a usage and similar to 4Q 2024, driven by continued working capital headwinds as we ramp production, as well as normal seasonality. We still expect the first half to be a use of cash with the second half turning positive and accelerating as we exit 2025.
CapEx investments stepped up last year and could increase by approximately $500 million in 2025 to support planned growth across both the commercial and defense businesses. Importantly, we expect to exit the year with real momentum in the business as we return to normal production rates.
This outlook will be underwritten by a few critical factors; increasing 737 production rates through the year; moving 787 steadily towards its long-term production rates; liquidating our legacy 737 and 787 inventory and shutting down both shadow factories; strategically investing in the business, including the 777X production ramp and CapEx to support planned growth across the portfolio; improving our defense business as we continue to mature the fixed price development programs and work to transition recently challenged programs with our renewed focus on disciplined program management and stabilizing the business; and finally, continuing to demonstrate strong performance across our services business.
Broadly, the markets we serve continue to be significant, and our backlog of more than $0.5 trillion demonstrates that our product portfolio is positioned to win. Long term, these fundamentals underpin our confidence as we continue to manage the business with a long-term view built on safety, quality and delivering for our customers.
With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.

David Strauss
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.
Hi, David.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Strauss
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Q
Kelly, I wanted to ask how you viewed the restart on MAX, how that's gone. You mentioned some of the - or you mentioned KPPs that you have with the - or KPIs that you have with the FAA. Can you maybe elaborate on what exactly those are, how close you're already hitting, what's necessary to get to go above 38 airplanes a month?
And then, Brian, can you just give us an idea of what to expect for all-in MAX and 787 deliveries in 2025? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Kelly Ortberg
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.
A
Yes, David. So, let me talk about the production startup on MAX. So, as you know, we came out of the strike and didn't actually jump right on building aircraft. We spent time training the workforce, getting them all up to speed, but also really, as I said, balancing the line, which is really important starting the lineup in a stable manner. And it already is paying dividends.
We're seeing the production process come back very well, and I feel pretty good about where we are right now with the production rate. Remember that we've got a significant amount of inventory, both in airplanes and in supply parts. So, I don't see any constraints right now from the supply chain for us in ramping up the 737 to the 38 airplanes a month rate.
And notably, the work at Spirit has - during the strike, has really paid off. That team has done a great job of improving the overall performance and quality of the fuselages, which are going to help flow through the factory. So, as I said, it's early days, but I feel really good, and I think our deliberate plan is going to pay dividends for us going forward.

Brian J. West
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.
A
David, a little bit on how to think about 737 deliveries for the year. We're not putting out formal guidance, a little too early for that. But let's just talk about a framework for the year. So, January is off to a very solid start, and delivery should be in the high-30s for the month.
Now, keep in mind, some of these airplanes are the benefit of clearing the delivery center ramp that had accumulated in the November or December timeframe. So, there's an advantage of a nice tailwind entering the

year. We expect February will be lighter because there's fewer manufacturing days and also the timing of the factory restart and then March is likely to be better than February as we begin to get more predictability.
So, as we've said, the first half is going to reflect our gradual, steady restart of the factory. And the second half is likely going to benefit from achieving higher production rates, which include the 38 airplanes per month target and possibly higher based on approval from the FAA, as Kelly mentioned.
So, as we sit here today, we've got a lot of work in front of us. 2025, in some ways, could look like 2023, maybe a bit better, if things go our way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Kelly Ortberg
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.
A
Hey, David, let me come back also and talk about the six KPIs that you asked about. So, these are KPIs that we've agreed with FAA on what the threshold is and where the control limits we want to operate. And these are what we've collectively determined will measure the stability of our production system.
I'll quickly tell you what the six are. They're NoE, notice of escape hours, shortages, part shortages, employee proficiency, rework by line, [ph] travelers who work (00:28:29) at rollout and the ticketing performance. And so, I will say it's a little bit early because we have a lot of inventory yet of planes that were in process that we're going through, but early indications is that all the KPIs are looking and trending in the right direction.
So, I feel so far so good, but it will be important to see and continue to measure these KPIs as we continue to ramp up. And remember, we need to get to 38 airplanes and show stability at 38 airplanes with these KPIs. And we won't go to the FAA for a rate increase. We won't request one, if we don't see these KPIs performing the way that we want to.
And so, I think we've got a disciplined approach. As I said in my remarks, I'm pleased that it's pretty well grounded in facts and data. So, there's no subjectivity here as far as what it's going to take. But we've got to perform. And Stephanie and the team are clearly focused on performing to these KPIs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Arment
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Q
Yes. Good morning, Kelly and Brian. Hey, Brian, maybe if you could walk us through a little bit on the free cash flow dynamics for 2025? I know you called out a few things, some of the moving parts. But just thinking about working capital headwinds or 777X spend or BDS losses, we've been estimating about a $5 billion outflow this year. I think it's little above the Consensus at $4 billion. Anything to highlight that you could help us maybe that potentially could be reduce that outflow or how are you thinking? I know you gave us the first half versus second half dynamics, but anything else that you could provide more color on? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. West
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.
A
Yeah, sure, Peter. So, 2025 free cash flow is largely going to be consistent with what we've said at our October earnings call with the two adjustments that I noted, which is CapEx a little bit higher based on some growth programs that we're anxious to invest in and the impact of a few hundred million based on the updated BDS charges. So, it's consistent with those two adjustments.

SEATTLE -     CEO Kelly Ortberg took over at Boeing knowing that the company was in trouble. Those troubles added up to an $11.8 billion loss last year, the company reported on Tuesday.
However, during its earnings call and interviews with Reuters and other news outlets, Ortberg indicated the worst is behind Boeing. He said its commercial airplane division is fixing lingering production problems and expects to ramp up production of its most popular jet, the 737 MAX, to 38 per month later this year, with further increases to follow, pending federal regulators' approval.
A hopeful ""show-me"" was the reaction from half a dozen industry analysts.
There are reasons for optimism, said Gautam Khanna, an aerospace analyst with TD Cowen. Since Ortberg took the reins in early August, Boeing appears to be taking a more deliberate approach to solving production problems by slowing down now in order to avoid getting derailed when output speeds up later.
As of Tuesday, Boeing had delivered 33 737 MAX jets in January, company CFO Brian West said on the earnings call. That was well above its pace in prior months.
Boeing's stock is up 2.8% since Ortberg started on Aug. 8. It jumped after Boeing released earnings results, but gave back some gains on Wednesday.
Even if Ortberg delivers on the goals he laid out, Khanna said, whatever he says now is haunted by his predecessors' bullish assurances that proved hollow: James McNerney on 787 delays and cost overruns; Dennis Muilenburg and the 737 MAX crashes; and David Calhoun on supply chain and production quality problems.
""Everyone's scarred from the history,"" he said.
SKEPTICAL SUPPLIERS
Suppliers, especially, have been hurt by investing for rate increases that did not come through. Many are wary of investing now and ending up financially vulnerable.
""A lot of people are holding on to their funds,"" Independent Forge president Andrew Flores said. The company in Orange County, California, supplies aluminum parts for the 737 MAX.
""I see light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a long tunnel,"" he said.
For the business to improve, suppliers need to trust that Boeing will make good on ramping up production and invest in capacity.
""The guys in the middle want to trust (Ortberg), because if Boeing improves, their business improves,"" said Phil Gibbs, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
A problem for Ortberg: at the moment, suppliers are making their own decisions, the head of a Boeing supplier said. He spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern of retribution.
After a 53-day strike shut down almost all Boeing airplane production last year, ""it's easy to be optimistic in a relative sense: The strike is over and production is ramping up,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with AeroDynamic Advisory.
However, increasing production ""is not the same as returning the company to a positive strategic direction,"" Aboulafia said. He pointed to management-employee relations during Ortberg's brief tenure.
Boeing endured ""a 53-day strike that should have been settled in 53 hours,"" and Boeing engineers' union is investigating allegations that the company is using the reductions to move work to non-union areas, Aboulafia said.
Ultimately, ""the path (to increase jetliner production) is there, and the market is with them,"" Aboulafia said. ""The market wants its jets.""

LONDON (Reuters) -     Ryanair is confident that Boeing will ramp up its production of 737 MAX jets to 38 per month this summer and that it will be allowed by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to then increase that to 42, its CEO said on Wednesday.
Michael O'Leary, whose airline is one of the largest customers of the 737 MAX, was speaking in London following meetings with Boeing management in Seattle in recent weeks and ahead of a visit by Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg to Ryanair Dublin in February.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     President Donald Trump said Tuesday night he had asked Elon Musk's SpaceX to return two NASA astronauts from the International Space Station, who were already scheduled to fly back on a SpaceX capsule in March.
Musk earlier on Tuesday said Trump had asked him to return the two astronauts ""as soon as possible,"" suggesting a change to NASA's current plan for a late March return. ""We will do so,"" Musk said.
""I have just asked Elon Musk and @SpaceX to 'go get' the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!""
His demand that SpaceX retrieve veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been assigned a SpaceX ride home since August, was an unusual intervention by a U.S. president into NASA's operations that caught many agency officials by surprise, two officials said.
A NASA spokesman did not immediately return requests for comment.
Wilmore and Williams flew Boeing's Starliner spacecraft to the ISS last summer for an eight-day test mission that instead has lasted nearly a year because of problems with the craft's propulsion system.
NASA in August, during President Joe Biden's administration, deemed Starliner too risky to bring them back to Earth and tapped SpaceX to return them on a Crew Dragon spacecraft.
That craft is already docked with the space station, having flown there for NASA's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission in September with empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.
The astronauts' original February departure date on Crew-9 was delayed to late March because SpaceX needed more time ""to complete processing"" of a new Crew Dragon capsule that will replace theirs for the Crew-10 mission, NASA said in December.
The agency has a delicately coordinated ISS schedule, and an early return might leave the station's U.S. contingent understaffed.
It was unclear whether Trump's demand would mean NASA bringing Crew-9 back to Earth before the Crew-10 capsule arrives, or SpaceX launching Crew-10 earlier than planned.
Returning Crew-9 to Earth before Crew-10's arrival would mean NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who flew to the ISS with a Russian crew in September, would be the only American aboard the station, a rare staffing imbalance that NASA has said complicates maintenance of the station's U.S. components.
Wilmore and Williams are among seven astronauts on the ISS, and they remain healthy and busy with routine scientific research aboard the station, NASA has said.
Though Starliner's development since 2019 has been a persistent challenge for Boeing, rife with engineering troubles and cost overruns, some Trump advisers in recent months have sought to blame Biden, although the former president had no involvement in Starliner's development.

Shares of industrial and transportation companies rose after strong factory data and mixed earnings.
Orders for durable goods such as refrigerators -- items designed to last three years or more -- rose 0.3% in December, when transportation goods were excluded. Overall orders fell 2.2% in the month, almost entirely because of a decline in bookings for Boeing aircraft. Boeing shares ticked up as the aerospace giant said it would streamline its work force following a quarterly loss and a series of engineering headaches.
Lockheed Martin shares slid after the defense contractor booked multibillion-dollar losses on classified programs at its aeronautics and missile units.
President Trump's Iron Dome executive order will boost major defense companies, said analysts at brokerage TD Cowen.
A White House freeze on potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in government ""financial assistance,"" set to go into effect at 5 p.m. ET Tuesday, would upend decades of federal budget policy, temporarily slamming the brakes on thousands of programs both in the U.S. and around the world.
General Motors is taking steps to soften the blow of U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada, including expediting vehicle imports from those countries and strategizing ways to potentially build more pickup trucks domestically.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     The U.S. Senate voted 77 to 22 on Tuesday to confirm former Representative Sean Duffy to head the U.S. Transportation Department.
President Donald Trump's pick says Boeing needs ""tough love"" to get back on track after a 2024 mid-air emergency and vowed not to approve additional 737 MAX production until the planemaker makes safety improvements. Duffy will oversee billions of dollars in unspent infrastructure funds and told lawmakers an ongoing safety probe into Tesla will continue when he takes office.

STORY: Boeing reported an annual loss of $11.83 billion on Tuesday (Jan.28) - its largest since 2020.
The planemaker has grappled with problems at its commercial and defense units and the fallout from a crippling strike by U.S. West Coast factory workers.
The loss demonstrates the challenges facing CEO Kelly Ortberg in turning around the firm.
Particularly as it cedes ground to rival Airbus in the delivery race.
And comes under the crosshairs of regulators and customers following a series of missteps.
The company reported a quarterly cash burn of $4.1 billion, a metric closely watched by investors.
That was slightly lower than analysts' expectations.
Ortberg, who took the helm of the planemaker in August, said the company was making progress in restoring stability to its struggling production lines.
That's after a mid-air accident a year ago raised concerns about the safety of its jets.
The company reported a loss of $3.86 billion in the fourth quarter due to what Ortberg called ""disappointing"" charges in several fixed-price defense programs.
After banking record-high profits in the 2010s, Boeing has bled more than $30 billion since 2019.
Two fatal crashes of its best-selling 737 MAX jet triggered production quality and safety concerns.
As well as worries that it had misled regulators during the plane's certification process.
While the mid-air panel blowout on a nearly new 737 MAX last January dragged Boeing into another crisis.",Neutral,96.47

Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided:
Core Operating Earnings/(Loss), Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings/(Loss) Per Share
Core operating earnings/(loss) is defined as GAAP Earnings/(loss) from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as Core operating earnings/(loss) expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings/(loss) per share is defined as GAAP Diluted earnings/(loss) per share excluding the net earnings/(loss) per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operatingpension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/ (loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-servicepension and post- retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAPmeasures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided on page 12 and 13.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow reduced by capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. See Table 2 on page 2 for a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating cash flow.

Boeing is working with the Trump administration to speed up delivery of two replacement presidential aircraft, better known as Air Force One, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in an interview on Tuesday.
The U.S. planemaker has already lost more than $2 billion on the fixed-price program and the planes are not expected to be delivered until later this decade, several years behind schedule.
""Clearly, the president would like the airplane earlier, and so we're working to see what could be done to accomplish that,"" Ortberg told Reuters.
Ortberg said he is focused on stabilizing the company around its strengths. He said he is looking at non-core segments to sell, likely from Boeing's defense, space and services divisions. Boeing's commercial airplanes business is already streamlined, he said.
For now, that business is focused on stabilizing and ramping up production of its existing airplanes, and he said he does not plan to start work on a new airplane program in the near future.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Boeing posted a fourth-quarter loss of $3.8 billion on Tuesday as a machinists strike and other problems continued to plague the troubled aircraft manufacturer.
Boeing has lost more than $35 billion since 2019 following the crashes of two then-new Max jets that killed 346 people. For the full year 2024, Boeing logged a loss of $11.8 billion.
The numbers Boeing released are in line with what the company pre-reported last week, including nearly $3 billion worth of charges in the period due to the labor stoppage, job cuts and problems with a number of government programs.
Boeing's loss per share was $5.46 per share, well above the $3.08 loss that Wall Street analysts expected, according to the data firm FactSet.
The fourth quarter caps a rough year for Boeing. A strike by the machinists who assemble the best-selling 737 Max, along with the 777 jet and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington, halted production at those facilities and hampered Boeing’s delivery capability.
The walkout ended after more than seven weeks when the company agreed to pay raises and improved benefits.
The company reiterated much of what it reported in last week's release, including that it took charges totaling $1.1 billion related to the 777 and 767 programs in the fourth quarter. Boeing took an additional $1.7 billion in charges related to a number of government programs including a military refueling tanker and Air Force One replacement jets.
Boeing said revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $15.2 billion, below analysts’ updated estimate of $15.7 billion, according to FactSet. Full-year revenue came in at $66.5 billion, a 14$ decline from 2023.
As it also reported earlier this month, Boeing said it supplied 348 jetliners last year, more than a third fewer than the 528 the company finished for airlines and leasing outfits in 2023 and less than half the number of jetliners that Airbus delivered last year.
Deliveries are an important source of cash for plane manufacturers since buyers typically pay a large portion of the purchase price when their orders are fulfilled.
More than three-quarters of the planes that Boeing furnished were 737 Max jets, a reminder of how integral its best-selling airline model has been to the company’s fortunes and challenges.
The company had expected to ramp up production in 2024 until a panel called a door plug blew off a 737 Max shortly after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, in early January. In the wake of the incident aboard an Alaska Airlines flight, the Federal Aviation Administration capped production of Max jets until Boeing could convince federal regulators it had corrected manufacturing quality and safety issues.
The hit to the company’s finances and reputation extended to sales of new aircraft. Boeing received no 737 Max orders for at least two months and ended the year far behind Airbus in total net orders for commercial planes, an indicator that factors in cancellations.
Shares of Boeing Co, based in Arlington, Va., nudged up less than 1% before the opening bell.

(Reuters) -     Boeing on Tuesday reported an annual loss of $11.83 billion, its largest since 2020, as it grappled with problems at its commercial and defense units and the fallout from a crippling strike by U.S. West Coast factory workers.
The loss demonstrates the challenges facing CEO Kelly Ortberg in turning around the planemaker as it cedes more ground to rival Airbus in the delivery race and comes under the crosshairs of regulators and customers following a series of missteps.
Ortberg, who took the reins of the planemaker in August, however, said the company was making progress on restoring stability to its struggling production lines after a harrowing mid-air accident in 2024 raised concerns about the safety of its jets.
Boeing's fourth-quarter results included ""disappointing"" charges in several fixed-price defense programs, Ortberg said, while adding that the company was ""now more proactive and clear-eyed on the risks"" to the programs.
The company's Defense, Space & Security business has lost $3.15 billion in the first nine months of 2024.
The planemaker last week flagged an overall fourth-quarter loss of about $4 billion, nearly triple the size expected by Wall Street.
Ortberg reiterated the company's four-part plan to turn the business around including undertaking a ""multi-year journey"" to fix Boeing's culture, ""perhaps the most important change we need to make.""
After banking record-high profits in the 2010s, Boeing has bled more than $20 billion since 2019 after two fatal crashes of its best-selling 737 MAX jet triggered production quality and safety concerns and worries that it had misled regulators during the plane's certification process.
The COVID-19 pandemic further squeezed the company, while the mid-air panel blowout on a nearly new 737 MAX in early 2024 dragged Boeing into another crisis.
""We have completed deep dives on all of our challenging fixed-price development programs,"" Ortberg said on Tuesday in a letter to employees.
Ortberg added Boeing has made progress with its supply chain and has returned to an output rate of five 787 jets per month at the end of 2024, despite delays in areas like seats.
Boeing's commercial planes division, now focused on getting three of its models certified, has a good handle on fixing a thrust link issue uncovered on its 777X widebody, which resumed flight tests earlier this month, he added.
Ortberg was guarded in his message about the status of solving problems with anti-icing systems on the 737-7 and -10 models. The company is ""still working through the testing phase focusing on finalization of the anti-icing design solution,"" he said.
The company continues to invest in ""core businesses while streamlining our portfolio in areas that are not core to our future,"" he said.

*Non-GAAP measure; complete definitions of Boeing's non-GAAP measures are on page 5, ""Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures.""
The Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] recorded fourth quarter revenue of $15.2 billion, GAAP loss per share of ($5.46) and core loss per share (non-GAAP)* of ($5.90) (Table 1) primarily reflecting previously announced impacts of the IAM work stoppage and agreement, charges for certain defense programs, and costs associated with workforce reductions announced last year. Boeing reported operating cash flow of ($3.5) billion and free cash flow of ($4.1) billion (non-GAAP)*.
""We made progress on key areas to stabilize our operations during the quarter and continued to strengthen important aspects of our safety and quality plan,"" said Kelly Ortberg, Boeing president and chief executive officer. ""My team and I are focused on making the fundamental changes needed to fully recover our company's performance and restore trust with our customers, employees, suppliers, investors, regulators and all others who are counting on us.""

Cash and investments in marketable securities totaled $26.3 billion, compared to $10.5 billion at the beginning of the quarter, primarily driven by a $24 billion capital raise partially offset by free cash flow usage and debt repayment in the quarter (Table 3). Debt was $53.9 billion, down from $57.7 billion at the beginning of the quarter, driven by the early repayment of a $3.5 billion bond originally maturing in 2025. The company maintains access to credit facilities of $10.0 billion, which remain undrawn.
Total company backlog at quarter end was $521 billion.

Commercial Airplanes fourth quarter revenue of $4.8 billion and operating margin of (43.9) percent reflect the previously announced impacts associated with the IAM work stoppage and agreement including lower deliveries and pre-tax charges of $1.1 billion on the 777X and 767 programs (Table 4).
The 737 program resumed production in the quarter and plans to gradually increase production rate. The 787 program exited the year at a production rate of five per month and recently announced plans to expand South Carolina operations. In January, the 777X program resumed FAA certification flight testing, and the company still anticipates first delivery of the 777-9 in 2026.
Commercial Airplanes booked 204 net orders in the quarter, including 100 737-10 airplanes for Pegasus Airlines and 30 787-9 airplanes for flydubai. Commercial Airplanes delivered 57 airplanes during the quarter and backlog included over 5,500 airplanes valued at $435 billion.

Defense, Space & Security fourth quarter revenue of $5.4 billion and operating margin of (41.9) percent reflect the previously announced pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion on the KC-46A, T-7A, Commercial Crew, VC-25B and MQ-25 programs.
In January, the U.S. Air Force announced an updated acquisition approach for the T-7A Red Hawk that allows the company to provide a production-ready configuration to the customer prior to low-rate initial production, which better supports the operational needs of the customer and reduces future production risk.
During the quarter, Defense, Space & Security captured an award from the U.S. Air Force for 15 KC-46A Tankers, secured an order for seven P-8A Poseidon aircraft from the U.S. Navy, and delivered the final T-7A Red Hawk engineering and manufacturing development aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. Backlog at Defense, Space & Security was $64 billion, of which 29 percent represents orders from customers outside the U.S.

Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided:
Core Operating Earnings/(Loss), Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings/(Loss) Per Share
Core operating earnings/(loss) is defined as GAAP Earnings/(loss) from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as Core operating earnings/(loss) expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings/(loss) per share is defined as GAAP Diluted earnings/(loss) per share excluding the net earnings/(loss) per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided on page 12 and 13.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow reduced by capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. See Table 2 on page 2 for a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating cash flow.
Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""expects,"" ""intends,"" ""projects,"" ""plans,"" ""believes,"" ""estimates,"" ""targets,"" ""anticipates,"" and other similar words or expressions, or the negative thereof, generally can be used to help identify these forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements relating to our future financial condition and operating results, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to be accurate.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. Among these factors are risks related to: (1) general conditions in the economy and our industry, including those due to regulatory changes; (2) our reliance on our commercial airline customers; (3) the overall health of our aircraft production system, production quality issues, commercial airplane production rates, our ability to successfully develop and certify new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and the ability of our aircraft to meet stringent performance and reliability standards; (4) changing budget and appropriation levels and acquisition priorities of the U.S. government, as well as significant delays in U.S. government appropriations; (5) our dependence on our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as the availability of highly skilled labor and raw materials; (6) work stoppages or other labor disruptions; (7) competition within our markets; (8) our non-U.S. operations and sales to non-U.S. customers; (9) changes in accounting estimates; (10) our pending acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit), including the satisfaction of closing conditions in the expected timeframe or at all; (11) realizing the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures, including anticipated synergies and quality improvements related to our pending acquisition of Spirit; (12) our dependence on U.S. government contracts; (13) our reliance on fixed-price contracts; (14) our reliance on cost-type contracts; (15) contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments; (16) management of a complex, global IT infrastructure; (17) compromise or unauthorized access to our, our customers' and/or our suppliers' information and systems; (18) potential business disruptions, including threats to physical security or our information technology systems, extreme weather (including effects of climate change) or other acts of nature, and pandemics or other public health crises; (19) potential adverse developments in new or pending litigation and/or government inquiries or investigations; (20) potential environmental liabilities; (21) effects of climate change and legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; (22) credit rating agency actions and our ability to effectively manage our liquidity; (23) substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; (24) the adequacy of our insurance coverage; and (25) customer and aircraft concentration in our customer financing portfolio.
Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

DUBLIN (Reuters) -     Ryanair expects to receive 38 Boeing 737 planes by the end of the summer and possibly up to 42 by October if the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approves deliveries of the additional jets, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said on Monday.
O'Leary said he was ""reasonably hopeful"" that Boeing will manage to build up production, adding that Boeing's delivery delays were not tied to supply chain issues.

Shares of industrial and transportation companies fell amid mixed earnings.
Boeing lost roughly $4 billion in the most recent quarter when the jet maker was hit by a debilitating strike, suffered mounting losses in troubled U.S. government projects and incurred costs tied to sweeping job cuts rolled out at the end of the year.
British aerospace-and-defense firm Rolls Royce will manufacture nuclear reactors to power new U.K. submarines under a contract valued approximately at roughly $11.12 billion.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -     Canadian helicopter parts supplier Optima Aero is already moving inventory south of the border to minimize the risk from potential tariffs proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Optima, headquartered in Quebec, sends about $2 million worth of parts each year to Texas, where its local division provides maintenance services for local law enforcement and U.S. border protection, a priority mission for Trump's administration.
""A tariff on Canada would make it tough to keep that business,"" said Optima President Tony Gault, who estimates 6% of the Montreal-area company's $32 million in annual revenue could be subject to tariffs.
Trump is threatening 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico starting on Feb. 1.
From repositioning parts to stocking up on materials such as steel and lobbying for tariff exemptions, aerospace suppliers are scrambling to limit tariff risk to their bottom lines. The tariffs, if implemented, could raise costs for already-stressed suppliers and their planemaking customers, such as U.S.-based Boeing.
GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp said on Thursday the company is doing contingency planning and has been in frequent contact with the Trump administration.
Some aerospace and defense executives have proactively sought tariff exemptions from the administration, according to one aerospace industry source and one source in Trump's transition team.
Reuters contacted nine aerospace suppliers in Canada and the United States, seven of which said they could be harmed if tariffs are imposed, adding that they have limited options without passing costs on to customers.
The White House was not immediately available for comment.
COMPLEX WEB
The aerospace industry consists of a sprawling network of global suppliers, making targeted tariffs difficult to implement without major disruptions to plane and helicopter makers.
Canada is the U.S.' top import country and third-largest export country for aerospace by dollar value, according to the Aerospace Industries Association. Canadian manufacturers produce engines for General Dynamics Corp's Gulfstream and Textron, as well as landing gear for Boeing and Airbus.
Boeing and suppliers Honeywell and Pratt Canada parent RTX declined comment. Textron's CEO and Airbus' Canadian division said they are waiting for tariff specifics.
Canada exported C$12.8 billion ($8.91 billion) of aerospace and defense-related products to the U.S. and imported C$10.2 billion worth, according to 2023 government data. Canada has threatened retaliatory tariffs if targeted by Trump.
Some analysts and industry executives doubt Trump will impose blanket tariffs on Canada given the negative economic impact on the U.S. Even if tariffs are imposed, aerospace may not be a top priority, analysts say.
""It would be incredibly complicated,"" said Alex Krutz, managing director of aerospace advisory Patriot Industrial Partners, who does not believe the sector will be affected.
Mexico, also threatened by U.S. tariffs, has fast-growing aerospace hubs in Queretaro and Chihuahua, attracting large suppliers including Honeywell.
Industry executives have warned that slapping tariffs on aerospace parts, now sold duty-free under a global agreement, would create fresh headaches for money-losing Boeing, but also for the company's suppliers that have struggled due to the pandemic and the planemaker's recent lower output.
The financial pressures limit small suppliers' ability to defend against tariffs.
In Washington state, family-run supplier TNT Aerospace is trying to negotiate lower steel prices but cannot easily stock up due to inventory costs. President Aaron Theisen fears tariffs could raise prices of the metal.
""It doesn't take a large piece of steel to cost a lot,"" Theisen said.
US-CANADA TRADE
In Western Canada, heat treatment specialist Pyrotek regularly sends trucks from its British Columbia factory to Boeing's planemaking hub near Seattle to pick up parts from suppliers.
The trucks return to Pyrotek's Canadian factory near the border, where the company heat-treats the aluminum parts that it then returns to its mostly U.S. clientele.
""(Tariffs) would have an enormous effect,"" said President Jim Matheson. ""There's no one who can build a plane alone from the ground up.""
Mitchell Aerospace, a Montreal-area supplier of aircraft parts, sends sand castings to the U.S. for hot isostatic pressing, a manufacturing step that the company cannot carry out in Canada, President Guillermo Alonso said.
The castings then return to Canada before Mitchell ships them to customers around the world, including U.S. enginemaker Pratt & Whitney.
Warren Maruyama, a former Republican general counsel of the U.S. trade representative, sees the introduction of tariffs as a real possibility since they were a core Trump campaign promise and could be introduced easily using presidential powers.
In 2021, the United States and European Union agreed on a five-year truce in a transatlantic tariff war triggered by a record trade dispute over aircraft subsidies at the World Trade Organization.
U.S.-made planes are likely targets for retaliation by foreign countries, Maruyama added.
""Aircraft is an iconic American product.""

STORY: Boeing warned Thursday that it expects a fourth-quarter loss of about $4 billion.
That would be nearly triple Wall Street forecasts.
The glum outlook sent shares in the aerospace giant tumbling, down 3.5% in after-hours trade.
The loss would cap an awful year for Boeing.
Early in 2024, a midair blowout on one of its 737 Max jets revived concerns over the firm's manufacturing quality.
Regulators subsequently capped output of the planes, which are Boeing's best-selling product.
Later in the year, the company faced a crippling strike by West Coast factory workers.
That halted production of several models.
The company has also faced deep problems in its defense and space businesses.
That includes persistent and high-profile problems with its Starliner space capsule.
All told, that saw Boeing rack up nearly $8 billion in losses over the first nine months of 2024.

Boeing lost roughly $4 billion in the most recent quarter, dragged down by strikes, mounting losses in troubled U.S. government projects and costs tied to job cuts rolled out at the end of last year. The jet maker said it expects to report revenue of $15.2 billion for the latest quarter, compared with Wall Street's forecast of $16.6 billion. Its operations had negative cash flow of $3.5 billion in the December quarter, coming in slightly better than investors had feared. Shares fall 2%, to $175.02, in after-hours trading.
Texas Instruments reported lower profit and revenue in the fourth quarter, while its first-quarter outlook missed expectations. The chipmaker reported a profit of $1.21 billion on revenue of $4.01 billion, down from a profit of $1.37 billion on revenue of $4.08 billion a year earlier. For the current quarter, it guided for per-share earnings between 94 cents and $1.16, the midpoint of which is below the $1.17 a share that analysts polled by FactSet are expecting. Shares fall 4.3%, to $191.93, in postmarket trading.
Allurion Technologies said it would initiate a clinical study on the combination of certain weight-loss drugs and its Allurion program with the goal of improving muscle mass. Chief Executive Shantanu Gaur said the goal of the study would be to prove that combining the Allurion Balloon and Allurion Virtual Care Suite with GLP-1 therapy would lead to patients losing significant weight while increasing muscle mass and improving overall body composition. Shares rise 67%, to $6.17, in after-hours trading.

Boeing Co. said it incurred nearly $3 billion worth of charges in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to a lengthy labor stoppage, job cuts and problems with a number of government programs.
As a result, the Chicago-based aerospace giant said Thursday that it will report a loss of $5.46 per share next week when it issues its full financial results. Wall Street had been expecting a fourth-quarter loss of $1.80 per share.
The sizeable loss caps a rough year for Boeing. A strike by the machinists who assemble the best-selling 737 Max, along with the 777 jet and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington, halted production at those facilities and hampered Boeing’s delivery capability.
The walkout ended after more than seven weeks when the company agreed to pay raises and improved benefits.
The aerospace giant also announced previously it would reduce its workforce by 10%.
The company said Thursday that it took charges totaling $1.1 billion related to the 777 and 767 programs in the fourth quarter. Boeing took an additional $1.7 billion in charges related to a number of government programs including a military refueling tanker and Air Force One replacement jets.
Boeing said revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $15.2 billion, well below analysts’ estimate of $16.6 billion. Shares fell

Shares of Boeing fell Thursday after the company warned of a large loss in the fourth quarter to reflect charges associated with last year's layoffs, a work stoppage and agreement.
The stock was down 3.1% to $173 in post-market trading. Through Thursday's close, shares have fallen 12% over the past 12 months.
The U.S. aircraft maker said it expects a quarterly loss of $5.46 a share, compared with a loss of 4 cents a year earlier. It pre-released quarterly results which were expected on Jan. 28.
Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast a fourth-quarter loss of $1.55 a share.
The company had a loss of $9.97 a share and revenue of $17.84 billion in the third quarter.
Fourth-quarter revenue is forecast to come in at $15.2 billion, down from $22.02 billion last year and missing the $16.56 billion expected by Wall Street, according to FactSet.
Boeing said its operating cash flow is expected to remain negative at $3.5 billion.
Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg said that, while Boeing faces near-term challenges, the company took important steps to stabilize our business during the quarter, such as reaching an agreement with its IAM-represented teammates and conducting a successful capital raise to improve its balance sheet.
""We also restarted 737, 767 and 777/777X production and our team remains focused on the hard work ahead to build a new future for Boeing,"" Ortberg said.
Boeing said its commercial airplanes fourth-quarter results will reflect pretax earnings charges of $1.1 billion on the 777X and 767 programs, with the defense, space and security unit set to include pretax charges of $1.7 billion on the KC-46A, T-7A, Commercial Crew, VC-25B, and MQ-25 programs.

ARLINGTON, Va., Jan. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] announced today it will recognize impacts to its financial results related to the IAM work stoppage and agreement, charges for certain Defense, Space & Security programs and costs associated with workforce reductions announced last year when it reports fourth quarter results on January 28. The company expects to report fourth quarter revenue of $15.2 billion, GAAP loss per share of ($5.46), and operating cash flow of ($3.5) billion. Cash and investments in marketable securities totaled $26.3 billion at the end of the quarter.
""Although we face near-term challenges, we took important steps to stabilize our business during the quarter including reaching an agreement with our IAM-represented teammates and conducting a successful capital raise to improve our balance sheet,"" said Kelly Ortberg, Boeing president and chief executive officer. ""We also restarted 737, 767 and 777/777X production and our team remains focused on the hard work ahead to build a new future for Boeing.""
Commercial Airplanes results will reflect impacts associated with the IAM work stoppage and agreement including lower deliveries and pre-tax earnings charges of $1.1 billion on the 777X and 767 programs. The 777X program pre-tax charge of $0.9 billion reflects higher estimated labor costs associated with finalizing the IAM agreement and will be incurred over the next several years. The company still anticipates first delivery of the 777-9 in 2026. Commercial Airplanes expects to report fourth quarter revenue of $4.8 billion and operating margin of (43.9) percent.
Defense, Space & Security expects to recognize pre-tax earnings charges of $1.7 billion on the KC-46A, T-7A, Commercial Crew, VC-25B, and MQ-25 programs. The KC-46A program pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion reflects higher estimated manufacturing costs, including impacts of the IAM work stoppage and agreement. The T-7A program pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion was primarily driven by higher estimated costs on production lots in 2026 and beyond. Defense, Space & Security expects to report fourth quarter revenue of $5.4 billion and operating margin of (41.9) percent.

(Reuters) -     The Australian government said on Thursday it would buy A$50 million dollars ($31.36 million) of debt from the largest creditor of collapsed airline Regional Express Holdings to have more control during a voluntary administration process.
The acquisition from Asian private equity house PAG Asia Capital would make the government Rex's principal secured creditor and keep the airline serving Australia's rural towns, Transport Minister Catherine King and Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said in a statement.
It is ""an important step to prevent an adverse outcome for regional communities, such as liquidation, and ensure the continued connectivity of Australia's regional and remote communities,"" the statement said.
Rex entered voluntary administration in July, cutting hundreds of jobs and grounding its Boeing 737 flights between Australia's major cities, though it continues to operate flights to and from rural areas.
It owes about A$500 million to 4,800 creditors after failing to compete with Qantas and Virgin Australia, which together control 98% of the domestic market.
The government's A$50 million acquisition comes on top of a A$80 million loan in December to keep Rex's regional routes running as administrators Ernst & Young search for a suitable buyer.
King and Gallagher said the government had also guaranteed regional flight bookings during administration and facilitated early access to entitlements for former employees.
Australia's workplace relations department has already paid out A$7.1 million in 302 claims lodged by former employees, the statement added.

SEATTLE -     Boeing's engineering union is formally investigating claims from its members that the company is moving work to non-union locations in the United States and overseas.
The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) formally began investigating the allegations in December, when it requested relevant information from Boeing, the union's Director of Strategic Development Rich Plunkett said Wednesday.
Union officials worry that the company is using a company-wide downsizing mandate to send work away from the Seattle area, where SPEEA represents 17,000 Boeing workers.
In October, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said the company would cut roughly 10% of its workforce, or 17,000 jobs, ""to align with our financial reality."" The U.S. planemaker recorded nearly $8 billion in losses through the first nine months of 2024. The company is expected to report more losses when it releases its year-end results on Tuesday.
In November and December, Boeing issued layoff notices to more than 4,000 U.S. workers, including 660 to SPEEA members, according to publicly-available state employment records and the union.
Soon after the first round of notices went out, SPEEA officials started hearing from members that ""at least some of the work that was being performed by those subject to layoffs is now being sent to other Boeing locations,"" Plunkett said.
Boeing declined to comment on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     President Donald Trump's nominee to head the U.S. Transportation Department said he will keep in place a cap on production of Boeing 737 MAX planes put in place after a mid-air panel blowout last year until he is satisfied it can be safely raised.
""The cap will be maintained and will be lifted when I, in consultation with the career safety experts at FAA and the Administrator, have confidence that a production increase will not reduce the quality of the aircraft being produced,"" said former Representative Sean Duffy in written comments submitted to the Senate Commerce Committee.
In January 2024, then Federal Aviation Administration chief Mike Whitaker imposed the 38 planes per month production cap after a door panel missing four key bolts flew off a new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9.
Duffy, whose nomination was approved by the committee on Wednesday on a 28-0 vote, said last week that Boeing needed ""tough love"" to get back on track.
In his written responses to questions from senators on Wednesday, Duffy said he planned to meet with Boeing's leadership at the ""earliest feasible moment"" so he could ""make clear that the Department and the FAA will continue to hold them accountable to the action plan they developed, and which was accepted by the department.""
Duffy added that he ""will also be instructing FAA leadership to monitor the adequacy of the action plan.""
In May 2022, the FAA approved a three-year renewal of Boeing's Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program that delegates some aircraft certification tasks to the planemaker rather than the five years Boeing had requested. The approval will expire in a few months.
Duffy said he will work with the FAA Administrator and career safety experts ""on the future parameters of Boeing's ODA."" The arrangement came under scrutiny after two deadly 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 linked to one of the aircraft's systems.
Boeing declined to comment.
Whitaker stepped down as FAA administrator on Monday, when Trump took office, and the new administration has not nominated a successor or said who will run the agency on an acting basis.

WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (Reuters) -     President-elect Donald Trump headed to Washington on Saturday ahead of his inauguration on a U.S. military airplane supplied by U.S. President Joe Biden, as the outgoing president emphasized sticking with traditional transition norms.
Trump will arrive in Washington on Saturday evening for celebrations to mark his return to office on Monday.
For the occasion, he is ditching his navy and crimson ""Trump Force One"" he often flies in favor of a government plane Biden sent to Florida. Biden has stressed to his officials that they must work with Trump's transition team, a sharp contrast to the last transition when Trump refused to attend the inauguration or acknowledge Biden's win.
Both planes sat on the tarmac at Palm Beach International Airport before Trump's departure Saturday. Trump's son Eric and Eric's wife Lara boarded the private plane.
For his less than three-hour flight to Washington Dulles International Airport, Trump will fly aboard a specially configured Boeing 757-200 in trademark blue and white colors and bearing the words ""United States of America.""
His daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner were spotted boarding that aircraft Saturday afternoon.
It is the same model aircraft that's called Air Force Two when flown by the vice president but is also used by the first lady, cabinet members and other high-ranking officials.
It is the norm for presidents-elect to take such a government-provided plane to their inauguration, though Biden did not.
In 2021, Biden had planned to arrive by train but the plan was canceled after the Secret Service raised security concerns after thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, in a bid to overturn his election defeat.
The Trump administration offered no plane and Biden ended up taking a private jet to Washington, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Photographs from Trump's 2017 arrival in the Washington area to take office for his first term showed that he used a similar U.S. aircraft then.
The White House and the U.S. Air Force could not immediately be reached for comment.

They not only allow representatives of the business community to travel in comfort, but also facilitate the tightening of economic relations between Krakow, the entire Lesser Poland region and Paris.
Lukasz Strutynski, CEO, Krakow Airport
Not many places all over the world may be compared with Paris - a city in which the air is filled with the scent of freshly baked croissants, with a gentle accordion tune playing in the background. There are not many other places where the world seems to be slowing down when you are enjoying a cup of strong espresso, and where all sights and sounds remind you why Paris is called a city of fashion and art. The French capital offers a seamless blend of history and modernity. Its unique ambiance, the variety of tourist attractions and a wide range of business opportunities it offers make it an ideal destination for those wishing to take a short city break, as well as for travelers looking to enjoy longer stays. Regardless of the purpose of your visit, Paris guarantees truly inspiring experiences and unforgettable memories.
Mecca for art and exquisite cuisine enthusiasts
Paris is a true paradise for art lovers. The Louvre, Musee d'Orsay or the Centre Pompidou host some truly remarkable collections constituting the backbone of the world's cultural heritage. Strolling in the alleyways of Paris, one may admire its rich architecture - from the Gothic Notre Dame cathedral to the Baroque Versaille Palace or the iconic Sacre-Coeur basilica. All quarters of the city - from Montmartre to Le Marais - are teeming with their unique history and atmosphere. The architecture of Paris is a testament to more than two thousand years of the city's history. Each era has left its unique mark, contributing to a harmonious blend of styles that may be admired every step of the way. One cannot forget about the most renowned landmark of Paris - the Eiffel tower. The structure offers some spectacular views of the city that may be enjoyed from three different viewing decks. After dark, it offers a truly fascinating lighting show.
KRK-ORY_PLL LOT 03.jpg
Paris is also a perfect destination for sophisticated cuisine enthusiasts. Visitors may enjoy exquisite restaurants with Michelin star ratings, and traditional boulangeries serving croissants, baguettes and delicious coffee. Tasting local wines, cheeses and other uniquely French delicacies is another item on the must-do list. Having indulged their palates, visitors may continue enjoying Paris by taking romantic walks on Champs-Elysees, in the Luxembourg Gardens or along the banks of the Seine.
Global business center
The headquarters of numerous international corporations and organizations, such as OECD or UNESCO, are located in Paris. The La Defense district, one of Europe's largest business centers, offers state-of-the-art infrastructure for all types of companies. The city is also at the forefront of new technologies and innovation. Technology and environmental startups are supported here by numerous business accelerators and investment programs. The French capital city regularly hosts business events of global reach, such as the Paris Air Show, Masion&Objet or VivaTech. With its two international airports (Charles de Gaulle and Orly), high-speed TGV trains and the metro, Paris is one of the most accessible capital cities in Europe and attracts, each year, millions of tourists from all over the world.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -     Boeing resumed testing for its long-delayed 777X widebody jet on Thursday, with the first flight since the U.S. planemaker grounded the test fleet in August due to the failure of a key engine mounting structure.
The grounding came just five weeks after it had started certification flights for the 777-9 with officials from the U.S. aviation regulator onboard.
Federal Aviation Administration staff were not on board for Thursday's flight, according to the company.
The 777X is the successor to Boeing's 777, one of the most commercially successful long-haul airliners. The company initially planned to deliver the first 777X to launch customer Qatar Airways in 2020.
First delivery of the 777-9 has since been pushed back to 2026, followed by the smaller 777-8 and a freighter version later in the decade.
Boeing's other 777X airline customers include Emirates, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways. The planemaker has 481 777X orders, including 170 from Emirates and 60 from Qatar, according to Cirium, an aviation industry analytics company.
Boeing's 777-9 test plane made a return flight from Boeing Field in Seattle to Moses Lake, Washington on Thursday.
""We continue to execute a rigorous test program to demonstrate the safety, performance and reliability of the 777-9,"" Boeing said after it landed in the afternoon.
A company spokesperson declined to comment on how the airplane performed during the flight.

NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump’s pick to head the Transportation Department promised Wednesday to scrutinize Boeing's safety issues, streamline regulations and not interfere in ongoing agency investigations into Elon Musk’s electric car company if confirmed as secretary.
Former Wisconsin congressman Sean Duffy said at his Senate confirmation hearing that he would “restore global confidence"" in Boeing, hire more air traffic controllers and create federal rules for self-driving cars instead of leaving that to the states, something Musk's Tesla has been pushing for to help speed development of the technology.
But asked how he would handle ongoing investigations into Tesla, Duffy said he would allow the department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to follow the evidence and not interfere — even in the face of political pressure to do so.
""I will let NHTSA do its investigation,” said Duffy, an ardent Trump backer in his first term in office, a reality TV star and Fox News host.
Duffy, 53, is hoping to take over the Department of Transportation as the U.S. faces intense competition from other countries in electric cars and self-driving technology, in particular from China. That country came up several times during the hearing, as did Musk, the world's richest man with close ties to the president-elect who gave an estimated $250 million to Trump's presidential campaign.
“Without clear rules, or a patchwork of rules state by state, we put ourselves behind those countries that allow innovators to expand and grow,"" said Duffy, adding “We are in direct competition with China.”
“We are in a global race to out-innovate the rest of the world,” Duffy told members of Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
The massive transportation agency employs more than 55,000, spends tens of billions of dollars annually, oversees the nation's highways, railroads and airspace and sets safety standards for trains, cars and trucks.
The agency has opened probes into the safety of Tesla vehicles, especially what the company calls Full Self-Driving, a misnomer because the vehicles require human intervention at any moment. In October, NHTSA launched a probe Tesla's self-driving system covering 2.4 million vehicles after getting reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian.
Duffy’s decisions at the transportation department will have a direct impact on profits not only at Tesla but Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, which has billions of dollars of contracts with federal agencies. The transportation department's Federal Aviation Administration has occasionally fined the company for violations, including $633,000 last year for alleged safety violations during two Florida launches.
At one point in the hearing, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas brought up the fines, describing them as excessive and unnecessary and asking Duffy what he would do about them.
“I commit to doing a review and working with you and following up on the space launches,” Duffy said.
If confirmed, Duffy would replace Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay Cabinet member.
Duffy served as co-host of “The Bottom Line” on Fox Business until leaving the network in November.
He won a House seat as part of wave of Tea Party victories in 2010 after a campaign where he could be seen in a red flannel shirt chopping trees and telling voters he came from a “long line of lumberjacks "" and would bring his axe to Washington.
He resigned from Congress in 2019, citing a need to care for his nine children.
A former lumberjack athlete, Duffy met his wife on the set of MTV’s “Road Rules: All Stars” in 1998. His wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy, is co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -     Brazilian airline Gol released a revised five-year strategic plan on Wednesday as it prepares to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, saying the new forecasts would serve as a base for its reorganization.
Gol said in a securities filing it expects to emerge from Chapter 11 in May, and sees its net leverage ""substantially improving"" going forward as it rebuilds its network and returns to ""normal levels"" of core earnings by next year.
The carrier, one of Brazil's largest, filed for Chapter 11 in the United States in early 2024 as it grappled with high debts, hit by a fall in traffic due to the COVID pandemic and Boeing delivery delays.
""We have secured lessor concessions, addressed maintenance and past-due liabilities, launched a profit improvement plan, and reached agreements with key stakeholders,"" Gol's Chief Executive Celso Ferrer said in a statement.
""When implemented through the reorganization plan, they will deleverage Gol's balance sheet.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to head the Transportation Department will tell a Senate committee on Wednesday he aims to ensure worldwide trust in U.S. planemaker Boeing after a 2024 mid-air emergency.
""I will work with Congress and the FAA to restore global confidence in Boeing and to ensure our skies are safe,"" said Sean Duffy, a former U.S. House lawmaker, according to written testimony seen by Reuters.
The Federal Aviation Administration is maintaining tougher oversight of Boeing indefinitely, a year after a door panel missing four bolts flew off a new Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 in mid-air. It has also barred Boeing from expanding production beyond 38 MAX planes per month.
Boeing did not immediately comment.
FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker plans to step down on Jan. 20, while Deputy FAA Administrator Katie Thomson left the agency last week. Trump has not yet named a new nominee to head the department.
On Saturday, Trump said he was nominating Steve Bradbury, a former DOT general counsel, to serve as deputy DOT secretary.
Duffy will face a number of aviation issues including a persistent shortage of air traffic controllers, aging FAA facilities and a series of dangerous near-miss incidents.
The FAA is still about 3,000 controllers behind staffing targets and has about 10,600 certified controllers. In June, the FAA extended cuts to minimum flight requirements at congested New York City-area airports through October 2025, citing a shortage of air traffic controllers.
""In aviation, safety will remain the top priority. America needs more air traffic controllers,"" Duffy's written testimony says.
Duffy also said Trump told him DOT ""is a top priority for him and he wants to invest in rebuilding our nation's crumbling infrastructure.""
Duffy said he ""will work to reduce the red tape that slows critical infrastructure projects"" and address U.S. traffic deaths, which rose after the start of COVID to their highest level since 2005 and remain well above pre-pandemic levels.

Shares of industrial and transportation companies rose after a surprisingly weak reading of wholesale inflation quelled fears about factory costs and the interest-rate outlook.
The producer price index Boeing shares fell after the jet maker reported lackluster order levels for December.
The plane maker delivered 18 737s in December, twice the number it shipped out in October and November when a strike halted most of its production.
It was not enough to cushion the impact of the machinists' strike on total 2024 deliveries, which fell by 180 to 348 jets.

Boeing delivered less than half the number of commercial aircraft to customers than its European rival in 2024 as the American aerospace giant's output suffered under intensified government scrutiny and a factory workers' strike, according to data released Tuesday.
Boeing said it supplied 348 jetliners during the year. That was more than a third fewer than the 528 the company finished for airlines and leasing outfits in 2023 and less than half the number of jetliners that Airbus delivered last year.
Deliveries are an important source of cash for plane manufacturers since buyers typically pay a large portion of the purchase price when their orders are fulfilled.
More than three-quarters of the planes that Boeing furnished were 737 Max jets, a stark reminder of how integral its best-selling airline model has been to the company's fortunes and challenges. Boeing has lost money since 2019 following the crashes of two then-new Max jets that killed 346 people.
The company expected to ramp up production in 2024. Instead, a panel called a door plug blew off a 737 Max shortly after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, in early January. In the wake of the incident aboard an Alaska Airlines flight, the Federal Aviation Administration capped production of Max jets until Boeing could convince federal regulators it had corrected manufacturing quality and safety issues.
The hit to the company's finances and reputation extended to sales of new aircraft. Boeing received no 737 Max orders for at least two months and ended the year far behind Airbus in total net orders for commercial planes, an indicator that factors in cancellations.
Airbus had 826 net orders, while Boeing had 317.
A strike by the machinists who assemble the 737 Max, along with the 777 jet and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington, halted production at those facilities and hampered Boeing's delivery capability.
The walkout ended after more than seven weeks when the company agreed to pay raise and improved benefit demands.
Boeing has been losing money since 2019, after two Max jets crashed, killing 346 people. It needs the cash it earns from delivering new planes to begin digging out of a deep financial hole.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -     Deliveries of new Boeing jets bounced back in December after a crippling labor strike that slowed production last fall, but the company's annual deliveries dropped in 2024 to the lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company said on Tuesday that it delivered 348 commercial jets last year, down from 528 the previous year. New orders for jets in 2024 dropped to less than half as many as Boeing recorded one year earlier.
The company also recorded 569 gross orders and 377 net orders after cancellations and conversions.
Production quality issues, stricter regulatory scrutiny, supply chain delays and a seven-week strike slowed the U.S. planemaker's assembly lines. The company has taken a cautious approach to resuming production in the wake of the strike, which ended Nov. 5. Its 737 lines restarted in early December, as Reuters first reported.
The company delivered 30 jets in December, including 17 737 MAX and 9 787s. The monthly total was up from the 13 in November and 14 in October.
For the year, Boeing delivered 260 737 MAX, 51 787s, 18 767s and 14 777s.
Planemakers get most of their revenue when they deliver an airplane. New Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg told investors in October that he expects the company to continue to burn cash this year.
Boeing's annual order tallies plummeted from 1,456 gross orders in 2023 to 569 in 2024 and from 1,314 net orders after cancellations and conversions to 377.
After also adjusting for accounting standards, Boeing booked 317 net orders last year.
The company recorded 142 gross orders in December, including 30 787 orders for flydubai and 100 737 MAX orders from Pegasus Airlines. The Turkish airline is a longtime Airbus customer.
The flydubai orders were first announced in November 2023 but not finalized until last month.
Boeing in December also canceled 135 orders placed by India-based Jet Airways after India's highest court ordered the airline be liquidated, according to the planemaker.
It ended the year with 6,245 unfilled orders and 5,595 orders in its official backlog, which is adjusted for accounting standards.
The company was outpaced by its European rival, Airbus, which delivered 766 jets in 2024 and booked 826 net orders after cancellations and conversions. It was the sixth year in a row that Boeing has trailed Airbus.

A small, black drone with four rotors is shown in the foreground flying in front of a commercial airliner in the background. The airliner is painted white and the front facing windows can be seen behind the drone. Concrete platforms surround the commercial airliner and yellow ramps connect the platforms to the plane.
A Boeing 777-300ER aircraft is being inspected by one of Near Earth Autonomy's drones Feb. 2, 2024, at an Emirates Airlines facility in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
Near Earth Autonomy
A small business called Near Earth Autonomy developed a time-saving solution using drones for pre-flight checks of commercial airliners through a NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and a partnership with The Boeing Company.
Before commercial airliners are deemed safe to fly before each trip, a pre-flight inspection must be completed. This process can take up to four hours, and can involve workers climbing around the plane to check for any issues, which can sometimes result in safety mishaps as well as diagnosis errors.
With NASA and Boeing funding to bolster commercial readiness, Near Earth Autonomy developed a drone-enabled solution, under their business unit Proxim, that can fly around a commercial airliner and gather inspection data in less than 30 minutes. The drone can autonomously fly around an aircraft to complete the inspection by following a computer-programmed task card based on the Federal Aviation Administration's rules for commercial aircraft inspection. The card shows the flight path the drone's software needs to take, enabling aircraft workers with a new tool to increase safety and efficiency.
'NASA has worked with Near Earth Autonomy on autonomous inspection challenges in multiple domains,' says Danette Allen, NASA senior leader for autonomous systems.
'We are excited to see this technology spin out to industry to increase efficiencies, safety, and accuracy of the aircraft inspection process for overall public benefit.'
The photos collected from the drone are shared and analyzed remotely, which allows experts in the airline maintenance field to support repair decisions faster from any location. New images can be compared to old images to look for cracks, popped rivets, leaks, and other common issues.
The user can ask the system to create alerts if an area needs to be inspected again or fails an inspection. Near Earth Autonomy estimates that using drones for aircraft inspection can save the airline industry an average of $10,000 per hour of lost earnings during unplanned time on the ground.
Over the last six years, Near Earth Autonomy completed several rounds of test flights with their drone system on Boeing aircraft used by American Airlines and Emirates Airlines.
NASA's Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer program, managed by the agency's Space Technology Mission Directorate, aims to bolster American ingenuity by supporting innovative ideas put forth by small businesses to fulfill NASA and industry needs. These research needs are described in annual SBIR solicitations and target technologies that have significant potential for successful commercialization.
Small business concerns with 500 or fewer employees, or small businesses partnering with a non-profit research institution such as a university or a research laboratory can apply to participate in the NASA SBIR/STTR program.

(Reuters) -     Flight data and cockpit voice recorders on the Jeju Air jet that crashed on Dec. 29, killing 179 people, stopped recording about four minutes before it crashed, South Korea's transport ministry said on Saturday.
Here are some details on black boxes and moves to improve them.
WHAT ARE BLACK BOXES?
They are not actually black but high-visibility orange. Experts disagree how the nickname originated but it has become synonymous with the quest for answers when planes crash.
Many historians attribute their invention to Australian scientist David Warren in the 1950s. They have evolved from early devices using wire, foil or magnetic tape to digital chips inside bright metallic casings.
They are mandatory and the aim is to preserve clues from cockpit sounds and data to help prevent future accidents, but not to determine any civil or criminal liability.
There are two recorders: a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) for pilot voices or cockpit sounds and a separate Flight Data Recorder (FDR).
In broad terms, investigators say the FDR helps them analyse what happened and the CVR can - but not always - start to explain why. But experts caution that no two probes are the same and virtually all accidents involve multiple factors.
HOW BIG ARE THEY?
They weigh about 10 pounds (4.5 kilos) and contain four main parts:
* a chassis or interface designed to fix the device and facilitate recording and playback
* an underwater locator beacon
* the core housing or 'Crash Survivable Memory Unit' made of stainless steel or titanium and able to withstand forces equivalent to 3,400 times the feeling of gravity
* this housing contains the recording media which nowadays are finger-nail sized chips on circuit boards.
HOW ARE RECORDERS HANDLED?
Technicians peel away protective material and carefully clean connections to make sure they do not accidentally erase data. The audio or data file must be downloaded and copied.
The data must be decoded from raw files before being turned into graphs.
HOW MUCH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?
The capacity of flight recorders has been debated for years as authorities weigh improvements against the cost and the risk of inadvertently creating other problems, such as drawing power from other systems needed in an emergency. Cockpit monitoring has also been a sensitive topic with pilot unions.
FDRs must record at least 88 essential parameters but modern systems can typically track 1,000 or more additional signals.
The CVR usually contains two hours of recordings on a loop but this is being extended to 25 hours.
Implementing such regulatory changes can take years.
A spate of accidents in which recorders stopped working when onboard electrical power was lost, including an Egyptair flight from New York to Cairo in 1999, led the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board to recommend enough backup power to provide 10 minutes of extra recording.
The Federal Aviation Administration proposed the change in 2005 and it was adopted for new planes delivered from 2010, eight months after the 737-800 involved in the Jeju crash left the Boeing factory, according to data from FlightRadar24.
Pressure to lengthen the loop of voice data to 25 hours to reflect trans-oceanic flights began with French recommendations following the crash of Air France 447 in 2009, and accelerated after the disappearance of Malaysia's MH370 in 2014.
Last year, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act included the 25-hour requirement for cockpit voice recorders, echoing previous decisions in Europe.

RTX Corporation’s RTX unit, Raytheon, recently secured a $333.3 million contract for facilitating the full-rate production of Standard Missile-6 (SM-6). RTX will also supply spares and a round design agent for SM-6 under this agreement.
The majority of the work related to this contract will be performed in Tucson, AZ, and Huntsville, AL. This contract is projected to be completed by October 2027.The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. This contract includes options that, if exercised, will bring the total value of the agreement to $908.1 million.
With countries worldwide enhancing their defense capabilities, spending on advanced military arms and ammunition, including missiles and missile systems, has been rapidly increasing. RTX, as a prominent manufacturer of missile systems, has been benefiting from a steady flow of orders from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies. The recent contract is an example of that.RTX's SM-6 missile is an advanced and versatile defense system for naval ships. It can handle multiple missions, including defending against air attacks, surface threats and ballistic missiles, making it highly effective in protecting fleets. Its advanced design combines reliable technology to provide strong and cost-effective defense for the U.S. Navy and its allies.Such impressive features of this missile must have enabled the company to deliver more than 500 of SM-6 missiles to the U.S. Navy, which reflects the solid demand it enjoys in the missile market.
Rising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes have led nations to increase their focus on national security, particularly on missile defense systems in recent times, backed by the rapid development of advanced missile technologies over the last decade.This is likely to have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 5% for the global missiles and missile defense system market during the 2025-2030 period.Such massive growth projections offer a strategic advantage to RTX, which has a handful of combat-proven missiles in its product portfolio, like the TOW missile, Guidance Enhanced Missile, Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, Tomahawk, Standard Missile 2 and a few more, in addition to the SM-6.
Other defense companies that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding missiles and missile system market have been discussed below:Northrop Grumman NOC: Northrop Grumman provides high-speed, long-range strike weapons like the AARGM-ER, which is a supersonic, air-launched tactical missile system. It also develops and builds advanced missile defense technology, ranging from command systems to directed energy weapons, advanced munitions and powerful sensors.The company’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 19%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 3.4%.The Boeing Company BA: It manufactures various missile defense systems, including the Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Avenger. Boeing-built and supported air and missile defense systems have been protecting its customers for nearly 25 years against threats ranging from intercontinental ballistic missiles to hostile aircraft.The company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 19.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA’s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 22.1%.Lockheed Martin LMT: Lockheed Martin’s missile defense program includes the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 and Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense air and missile defense programs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing is donating $1 million to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, a spokesperson for the U.S. planemaker said on Thursday.
Boeing is joining many major U.S. companies including General Motors, Ford, Microsoft and Meta in donating for the Jan. 20 event.
The planemaker previously donated $1 million to the last three presidential inaugurations, including Trump's first in 2017.
American Airlines separately confirmed on Thursday it is also donating to the inauguration, but declined to say how much.
In 2016, Trump extracted a promise from Boeing that the cost of replacing Air Force One would not exceed $4 billion, and the company has since lost more than $2 billion on the significantly delayed program to deliver two new presidential aircraft.
Boeing also faces continuing tougher oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration, a year after a door panel missing four key bolts flew off a new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 in mid-air.
Trump's nominee to head the Transportation Department, Sean Duffy, told Reuters last month he wanted to make sure ""we have safe planes coming out of Boeing."" The FAA announced a new audit of Boeing in October. The Senate Commerce Committee will hold a confirmation hearing for Duffy on Wednesday.

The post Taiwanese startup Starlux Airlines doubles down on Airbus A350 freighter appeared first on FreightWaves.","Oops, something went wrong
Taiwan-based Starlux Airlines, which has been in business for five years and operates 26 passenger aircraft, is doubling down on its strategy to become a freighter operator in a region hungry for widebody shipping capacity.
The company on Thursday announced it has placed a firm order with Airbus for five more A350 next-generation freighters, doubling its previous order from last February.
Starlux Airlines will become the first Taiwanese airline to operate Airbus’ newly designed freighter later this decade. It said the A350 fleet will be operated by its cargo division on some of the world’s busiest freight routes. Starlux has previously said it is diversifying to take advantage of growing demand for electronic components and semiconductors, which are key manufacturing sectors in Taiwan.
Taiwan’s major cargo airlines are Eva Air and China Airlines, which last month said it will buy four 777-8 aircraft, the next-generation freighter being developed by Boeing.
“The cargo market is set to become a key element in our business model and will benefit from the advantages offered by Taiwan’s geographical location,” said Starlux CEO Glenn Chai. “The A350F is the perfect choice for Starlux, offering a similar payload-range capability as previous generation freighters, but with very significant reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions.”
The freighters offer commonality with Starlux’s existing fleet, which includes eight 350-900 passenger jets.
Air cargo demand increased more than 10% year over year in 2024. Red Sea shipping disruptions and the threat of U.S. dockworker strikes pushed more cargo to airlines. Many shippers procured inventory from overseas months earlier than usual to avoid potential transport delays and give themselves time to find limited aircraft capacity as e-commerce platforms reserve large swaths of supply under long-term contracts.
More than 20% of general air cargo volumes worldwide are now considered to come from e-commerce platforms, and upwards of 60% of air shipments out of the greater Hong Kong region originate with online marketplaces in China, according to local airlines and industry experts. Freighters operating last year out of China and other parts of Asia were nearly full, especially during the peak season.
Analysts and trade associations are predicting air cargo to grow in the midsingle digits this year.
Boeing recently forecast air cargo volumes will grow at a compound annual rate of 4% over the next 20 years. Interest in factory-built cargo jets and passenger-to-freighter conversions is rising because dedicated freighters give businesses greater flexibility and schedule reliability over shipping goods via passenger aircraft. About 600 to 650 large freighter aircraft, with payloads of 80 tons or more, are currently in operation. About half of them will reach retirement age in the next three to five years, according to Boeing.
Airbus has recorded 55 orders from 10 airlines and lessors so far for the all-new A350. FreightWaves reported in November that Etihad Airways plans to purchase three additional A350s and is negotiating final terms with Airbus. The aerospace manufacturer will officially count the the expanded Starlux order when all conditions are met, which will bring the order backlog to 60 aircraft, spokeswoman Katharina Wambach explained. Airbus says it expects to begin commercial deliveries of the new plane, which is still in final development and testing, in 2026.
The A350F, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines, can carry a payload of up to 120 tons and can fly up to 4,700 nautical miles. It will feature the industry’s largest main deck cargo door, designed to ease loading of shipping containers and nonstandard pieces of freight. The large cargo door offers the option of using 20-foot shipping containers, something that is rarely, if ever, done with traditional side-loading aircraft, said Crawford Hamilton, head of freighter marketing at Airbus, in an interview last March with STAT Media Group. More than 70% of the airframe is made of advanced materials. Airbus claims the lighter airframe and efficient Rolls Royce engines produce a 20% advantage in fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions over the legacy Boeing 777 currently in production, as well as the older Boeing 747-400.

DUBLIN (Reuters) -     A long-running production shortfall by planemakers will underpin supply and demand dynamics that are boosting airline and lessor profits for at least another decade, the head of the world's second-largest aircraft leasing company Avolon said on Friday.
Aircraft manufacturers and suppliers have struggled to keep up with a post-pandemic recovery in travel due to rising costs, labour and parts shortages, issues that have been exacerbated by safety woes at Boeing and a strike by its staff last year.
Avolon's annual outlook report predicted that airlines' net profit would rise by 16% to over $36 billion in 2025, driven by low fuel prices, strong revenue and the fact that plane shortages have allowed them to prioritise the most profitable routes.
""That production shortfall underpins the supply and demand balance, not just for the next three or four years, but for at least another decade,"" Avolon Chief Executive Andy Cronin told Reuters.
Cronin said Avolon's view that the supply and demand balance would be ""firmly in our favour"" over that time period spurred it to order 200 aircraft in 2023. It added 118 more aircraft last year through the acquisition of smaller rival Castlelake Aviation Limited, bringing its total fleet to 1,129 aircraft.
The Dublin-based lessor said Boeing and main rival Airbus will continue to struggle to hit their targets to ramp up production despite increasing their deliveries.
Avolon, which is a subsidiary of China's Bohai Leasing Co Ltd, also predicted that orders from Chinese firms will rise sharply to 800 aircraft in 2025, citing growth in travel demand and a need to replace an aging fleet.
While Avolon's report described the aviation outlook for 2025 as robust, it also noted that economic cycles usually last four to six years and that the current cycle is already in its fourth or fifth year, with growth in Europe slowing.
""We characterize it as a low visibility environment at the moment. I think there's uncertainty around foreign policy and trade policy, and consequential impacts as it pertains to the aviation industry,"" Cronin added.

Key Points
A bad year for Boeing translated into a miserable year for owners of some of the aerospace giant's largest suppliers.
In a year when the S&P 500 was up 23%, Hexcel (HXL 1.25%) shares traded down 15%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, as the aerospace supplier dealt with choppy demand for the composite materials that have become a foundational part of new aircraft manufacture.
Hexcel specializes in the production of carbon fiber materials that offer the durability of metals at a fraction of the weight, making them ideal for making airplanes and other large equipment more fuel efficient. Though the company sells to a variety of industrial and defense customers, commercial aerospace makes up nearly two-thirds of revenue.
Boeing, a big customer, has not been buying as much material as it had planned to just a few years ago. Boeing has been mired in a slump of its own doing. The company has experienced a number of high-profile manufacturing and engineering snafus in recent years, leading to a government-ordered slowdown in aircraft manufacturing.
There are a limited number of customers for Hexcel's materials, and Boeing's troubles trickled down to Hexcel productions. During 2024 Hexcel was forced to lower its financial expectations for the year and withdraw its longer-term guidance for double-digit compound annual revenue growth through 2026.
While there is reason to hope the worst is behind Boeing, it could take years for the company to regain its footing and normalize aircraft production. With most of Hexcel's troubles outside of management's control and no clear timetable for when things will recover, investors ran for the exits in 2024.
Even as demand slumped, Hexcel management did a decent job returning capital to investors. The company's share count has fallen by about 4% in the past year and is down 16% over the past decade. Hexcel also pays a modest dividend, currently yielding about 1%.
The cash is at least some reason to stay patient, but investors are eventually going to need to see the business rebound for this investment to work out. Hexcel's composite materials are a must-have part of the new plane supply chain, and with Airbus forecasting demand for more than 42,000 new deliveries over the next 20 years there should be ample need for Hexcel's products. 
The question is how quickly that demand materializes. There is great potential here, but investors will need to wait out Boeing's slump to see Hexcel gain altitude from here.

Key Points
Shares in aerospace giant Boeing (BA -2.33%) declined by 32.1% in 2024, according to data provided by  S&P Global Market Intelligence. It was an eventful year for the company, marred by operational mishaps, industrial action, senior management changes, significant cash outflows, and disappointing airplane deliveries. Here's what happened in 2024 and a sneak peek at 2024.
Last year had hardly begun before a high-profile door plug blowout on a Boeing 737 MAX on an Alaska Airlines  flight raised renewed safety and quality concerns at Boeing. Then-CEO Dave Calhoun deliberately slowed deliveries while the company worked on improving quality control in the spring. Slowing 737 MAX deliveries is one of the last things Boeing wants to do and the last thing airlines wish to see, but everybody wants to see Boeing ensure the quality of their airplanes.
It gets worse. A protracted dispute over a new labor contract led to strikes and the shutdown of production lines in the autumn, notably on the 737 MAX. The result is that Boeing got nowhere near its aim of achieving an initial rate of 38 deliveries a month for the 737 MAX.
Data source: Boeing presentations. Chart by author.
In addition, there was bad news on the widebody 777X airplane program. The successor to the widebody 777, the new airplane was initially supposed to have its first delivery in 2020. But management pushed the timeline out again and expects the first delivery in 2026. That's not only an issue for airlines waiting for the planes, but it also means more costs for Boeing and cash tied up in inventory.
As the chart below shows, it was another extremely challenging year at Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS). The segment battled ongoing supply chain pressures and incurred charges and losses on problematic fixed-price development programs procured in less inflationary times.
Data source: Boeing presentations. Chart by author.
On a more positive note, industry veteran Kelly Ortberg replaced Calhoun as CEO in August, and Boeing parted company with its BDS CEO, Ted Colbert, in September.
Image source: Getty Images.
While Ortberg has his hands full turning Boeing around, the recent large order for the 737 MAX from Pegasus Airlines highlights that airlines still have the confidence to place orders. Also, the company still has a multiyear backlog of orders for the 737 MAX, it can work through the problematic defense programs (most of the defense segment revenue is profitable), and there's no shortage of demand for widebodies like the 777X.
If Ortberg can improve execution, Boeing could have a great 2025 as it works toward developing a new plane by 2035.

Boeing,2025-01-09,Airbus Clinches a $315M Deal to Support UH-72 Lakota Helicopter,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=268a50cd10cccc48079dd6479ad8217c369df0bed11cc1523826a5bd8b1cebae,EADSY secures a $315 million deal to provide logistics support and engineering services for the UH-72 Lakota helicopter.,"Oops, something went wrong
Airbus SE EADSY secured a contract to provide logistics support and engineering services for the UH-72 Lakota helicopter. The award has been offered by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Valued at $315 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Dec. 31, 2025. The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Grand Prairie, TX.
As nations are upgrading their defense capabilities, expenditures on cutting-edge defense equipment and ammunition have been rising quickly. Increasing expenditures on military helicopters, which are essential for air combat operations, contribute to the rising defense expenditures. As a leading manufacturer of combat helicopters, Airbus has received a steady stream of orders from all over the world.More than 140 armed forces worldwide rely on Airbus for its expertise to produce high-quality multi-role helicopters. These copters are able to fulfill a wide range of operational military roles, such as armed reconnaissance, utility, attack, naval, maritime and special operations.In particular, EADSY’s UH-72 Lakota is a highly adaptable and reconfigurable helicopter capable of carrying out a wide range of tasks under a variety of climates and environments. Its missions are as diverse as its operational locations, encompassing training, general utility, search and rescue, reconnaissance, medical evacuation, disaster response, homeland security, counterdrug, command and control, and VIP transportation.
Amid rising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes, these combat-proven helicopters play a critical role in a country's security system. This is likely to have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 2.9% for the military helicopter market during the 2024-2030 period. Such growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market should bode well for Airbus.EADSY’s product portfolio consists of varied combat helicopters, such as the H125M, H160M, H175M, H215M, H225M, Tiger, NH90 and a few more. These enjoy solid demand in the global military helicopter market, with some 19,000 helicopters delivered across 150 nations.
Other defense companies that are expected to enjoy the perks of the expanding military helicopter market have been discussed below:Boeing BA: The company’s helicopters are renowned for their leading-edge, relevant solutions that provide capacity. Boeing’s product portfolio includes combat helicopters and rotorcraft like the H-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, AH-6 Little Bird and V-22 Osprey.Boeing has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 19.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA’s 2025 sales indicates an improvement of 21.9% from the 2024 estimated figure.Textron TXT: Its Bell business segment supplies advanced military helicopters and provides parts and support services to the U.S. Government and military customers outside the United States. Its portfolio of combat helicopters includes Bell 412M, Bell 429M, Bell 407M and Bell 505M. TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 7.4% from the 2024 estimated figure.Lockheed Martin LMT: Its Sikorsky business unit provides military and rotary-wing aircraft to all five branches of the U.S. armed forces, along with military services and commercial operators in 40 nations. Some of LMT’s renowned products are Armed Black Hawk, CH-53K, MH-60R SEAHAWK, Raider X, S-97 Raider, S-70 BLACK Hawk, etc.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT’s 2025 sales indicates an improvement of 3.9% from the 2024 estimated figure.
In the past six months, Airbus shares have risen 13.1% compared to the industry’s fall of 1.7%.

Boeing,2025-01-09,Lockheed Secures Contract for F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Jet Program,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b3fd798cff29a1a210ea617563443b5db2a5332b6e33b1eb0e14aba2cca4eaaf,LMT's unit secures a $678.4 million modification contract to provide support to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.,"Oops, something went wrong
Lockheed Martin Corporation’s LMT Aeronautics business segment recently clinched a modification contract to support the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft program. The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.
Valued at $678.4 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2028. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide various material modification kits, special test and tooling equipment, and associated seed assets to support the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and non-Department of Defense participants. The work related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX.
The F-35 program is widely recognized as the most advanced 5th-generation fighter jet, offering unmatched mission readiness. With cutting-edge sensors and communication systems, the F-35 is designed to operate seamlessly across multiple domains.These exceptional features must have been driving significant demand for the F-35 jets. This jet program’s demand trend can be gauged from the fact that since its launch, Lockheed has delivered 1,040 units as of Sept. 29, 2024.
Rising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes, along with rapid technological advancements in combat jets, have led nations to increase their defense spending on combat-proven jets, which constitute an integral part of their defense structure.This is likely to have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% for the global military aviation market during the 2024-2030 period.Such strong market prospects drive growth opportunities for Lockheed Martin, backed by its robust portfolio of combat jets, including the F-16, F-22 and F-21 aircraft, in addition to the F-35 jet. Lockheed Martin’s total backlog was $165.69 billion as of Sept. 29, 2024.
Other defense companies that are likely to benefit from the expanding global fighter aircraft market are discussed below:Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC: Northrop provides manned and unmanned air systems. It builds some of the world’s most advanced aircraft like the E-2C Hawkeye 2000, A-10 Thunderbolt II, F-5 Tiger Fighter Jet and many more.Northrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 19%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 3.4%.Embraer ERJ: The company offers a comprehensive portfolio of the most advanced aircraft in the combat market, which includes the A-29 Super Tucano light attack and advanced trainer and the C-390 Millennium military multi-mission aircraft.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ERJ’s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 18.3%. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 127.28% in the last four quarters.The Boeing Company BA: Its Defense, Space & Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft. BA’s product portfolio includes a range of combat-proven aircraft like the F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8, C-17 Globemaster III, EA-18G and a few more.Boeing has a long-term earnings growth rate of 19.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA’s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 21.9%.
Shares of LMT have risen 2.9% in the past six months against the industry’s 1% decline.

Vale (NYSE:VALE) just made waves in Brazil's infrastructure scene, renegotiating its railway concession contracts for the Carajas (EFC) and Vitoria a Minas (EFVM) lines. The deal, worth up to 11 billion reais ($1.78 billion), aims to modernize operations and clean up legacy terms from prior extensions that run until 2057. As part of this renegotiation, Vale is adding 1.7 billion reais to its railway provisions, signaling a serious commitment to optimizing its transport infrastructure. While final approvals are pending, this agreement positions Vale to streamline its obligations and keep its critical railways running smoothly for decades.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with VALE.
But that's not all. Vale Ventures, the company's venture capital arm, is doubling down on the future of sustainable mining with a strategic investment in Boston-based Electrified Thermal Solutions (ETS). ETS is developing groundbreaking tech that replaces fossil fuels in industrial heat processes with electricity, a move that could tackle the 20% of global emissions tied to this sector. This is no small betit's part of ETS's $19 million funding round and ties directly to Vale's larger $100 million push into tech-driven decarbonization. With ETS planning a commercial pilot by 2025, Vale is setting itself up to slash Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions while staying ahead in the global race to net-zero.

We recently published a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stands against the other best low priced stocks to invest in now.
According to a report by Charles Schwab published on December 9, the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 from a position of relative strength, but the risks of volatility, particularly those related to policy, are significantly higher compared to the previous year. This uncertainty is largely driven by the policy proposals of President-elect Donald Trump, whose unconventional governing style and fluid policy positions have made forecasting their impact on domestic and global conditions extremely challenging. The report highlights that Trump's policy proposals, which include lower taxes and reduced regulations, are generally seen as growth-positive. However, these are offset by proposals for higher tariffs on imported goods and mass deportations of illegal immigrants, which are generally considered stagflationary, at least in the short term.
In terms of the stock market, the report suggests that while equities can perform well from the beginning to the end of the year, the volatility is likely to be higher in 2025 compared to 2024. The S&P 500 is currently above its 50 and 200-day moving averages, which historically has been a positive indicator for future performance. However, the report cautions that after a year with 57 record highs, the median gain in the following year has historically been around 5.8%, suggesting a potential for a step back in performance. The report also notes that the S&P 500's 5-year normalized P/E ratio is quite stretched, indicating a product of market enthusiasm but not necessarily a near-term risk.
For small caps, the report notes that the Russell 2000 has struggled in the current bull market due to higher interest rates and weaker profit profiles. The report suggests that profitable small caps could perform well if economic growth holds and the Fed takes a gradual approach to rate cuts, but the index as a whole might continue to face challenges if earnings growth does not improve.

In an interview with Bloomberg on December 24, Jonathan D. Corpina, Senior Managing Partner at Meridian Equity Partners, discussed his outlook for U.S. stocks in 2025. Corpina noted that the market is finishing the year strong, supported by a resilient economy and key events such as the election and rate cuts being out of the way. He believes that the market will continue to move higher in 2025, though it will take a few quarters for the new administration to implement new policies and procedures.
Corpina also addressed investor expectations for strong double-digit earnings growth for S&P 500 companies, suggesting that while the bar is set high, it's important to manage expectations. He emphasized that the economy remains fragile, and companies are still adjusting to the new environment and administration. He advised a cautious approach, noting that there are many uncertainties that could impact the market in the coming year. On the U.S. financial sector, Corpina is optimistic. He anticipates a lot of M&A activity and IPOs in 2025, driven by a pro-business administration.
While the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 with a foundation of relative strength, the landscape remains fraught with uncertainty.

Vale,2024-12-26,Here is What to Know Beyond Why VALE S.A. (VALE) is a Trending Stock,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=005361dfdb865748e0d9f950c47e47421d368f8cdfa54a679f97a1880aa3b525,"Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to VALE (VALE). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Oops, something went wrong
VALE S.A. (VALE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -9.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Iron industry, which VALE falls in, has lost 11.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, VALE is expected to post earnings of $0.61 per share, indicating a change of +8.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.5% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.19 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.7%. This estimate has changed -2.6% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.99 indicates a change of -9.1% from what VALE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for VALE.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of VALE, the consensus sales estimate of $10.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -17.7%. The $38.67 billion and $40.36 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -7.5% and +4.4%, respectively.
VALE reported revenues of $9.55 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.1%. EPS of $0.56 for the same period compares with $0.66 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.54%. The EPS surprise was +36.59%.
Over the last four quarters, VALE surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
VALE is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about VALE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Vale,2024-12-17,RIO & BHP to Build Electric Smelting Furnace Plant to Lower Emissions,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d5e1afb651e90df148eb3f8ea5becec36297b76778ccba83c287b01242618015,Rio Tinto and BHP are set to build Australia's largest ironmaking electric smelting furnace pilot plant study to lower emissions.,"Oops, something went wrong
Rio Tinto RIO has joined forces with BHP Group BHP and BlueScope to develop Australia’s largest ironmaking electric smelting furnace (ESF) pilot plant in Western Australia. The BHP-RIO alliance will work on processing iron sourced from Pilbara using an electric furnace replacing traditional blast furnaces.
This could lead the way in decarbonizing the steelmaking process, which is the need of the hour considering that steel production accounts for around 8% of the world’s carbon emissions.
RIO, BHP and Bluescope, Australia's largest steelmaker, formed the NeoSmelt collaboration in February. This combined BHP and Rio Tinto’s knowledge of Pilbara iron ore with BlueScope’s unique operating experience in ESF technology. BlueScope is the operator of the world’s only ESF processing direct reduced iron (DRI) in New Zealand.
Woodside Energy will also join as an equal equity participant and energy supplier, subject to the finalization of commercial arrangements.
The NeoSmelt pilot plant will test and optimize production of iron from the ESF. The ESF is capable of producing iron suitable for the basic oxygen steelmaking process. Iron ore is first converted to DRI before being charged into the ESF. The DRI-ESF equipment can replace the traditional blast furnace. This can help in reductions of up to 80% in CO2 emission intensity compared with the conventional blast furnace steel route.The pilot plant would produce molten iron in the range of 30,000-40,000 tons a year. It will initially use natural gas to reduce iron ore to DRI. Once operational, the project aims to use lower-carbon emissions hydrogen for the process. The Western Australian Government will make A$75 million contribution to the project.
Subject to funding, the project expects to start feasibility studies in the second quarter of 2025. The final investment decision for the pilot plant is expected in 2026, with operations anticipated to start in 2028.
Steelmaking is responsible for around 8% of the world’s carbon emissions. Most of these emissions are created during the industrial process of transforming the raw material, iron ore, into steel. Miners, through individual research and partnerships, are working on developing technologies and solutions to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity of the steelmaking process.
Steelmaking accounted for 69% of Rio Tinto’s Scope 3 emissions in 2023. It has targeted reductions in Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions of 15% by 2025 and 50% by 2030, relative to 2018 levels. The company expects to achieve net zero emissions from its operations by 2050.
In 2023, RIO achieved a 6% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, which was below its 2018 baseline. The company has budgeted a total capital spending of $5-$6 billion over the 2022-2030 period, including $1.5 billion cumulative spending over the 2024-2026 period.
Fortescue Ltd FSUGY remains committed to eliminating fossil fuels with a target to achieve Real Zero terrestrial emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030. The company targets to achieve Net Zero Scope 3 emissions by 2040. The steelmaking process is the largest source of its Scope 3 emissions, accounting for 97% of Fortescue’s Scope 3 emissions.
In September 2022, the company committed $6.2 billion to decarbonize Pilbara operations. Fortescue’s fiscal 2025 projected capital guidance for decarbonization is $700 - $900 million.
BHP Group is also pursuing its long-term goal of net zero Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050. The company expects to cut down operational GHG emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.
BHP aims to support the development of steel production technology capable of 30% lower emission intensity compared with conventional blast furnace steelmaking. In fiscal 2024, BHP lowered Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 32% compared with the fiscal 2020 baseline. From this decade to fiscal 2030, BHP expects to spend around $4 billion on operational decarbonization.
VALE S.A. VALE plans to invest at least $2 billion to reduce its direct and indirect carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 33% by 2030 compared with its emissions in 2017. It will also help reduce its suppliers’ emissions (Scope 3) by 15% by 2035 compared with the emission level in 2018. Vale aims to become carbon neutral by 2050.
In the past year, shares of Rio Tinto have lost 17.7% compared with the iron mining industry’s 18.3% decline.

Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley expects elevated volatility in the mining sector through 2025, particularly in the first half, citing global growth headwinds and uncertain economic policies in China and the U.S.
The brokerage downgraded Vale SA ADR (NYSE:VALE) to ""equal weight,"" noting the iron ore miner's underperformance relative to peers despite recent positive catalysts, such as a new CEO and agreements addressing legacy issues. Iron ore supply surpluses and uncertain pricing are expected to weigh on the stock in the near term.
Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) upgraded Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO) and Nexa Resources SA (NYSE:NEXA) to ""equal weight,"" citing tighter supply forecasts for base metals like copper and zinc.
A near 12% pullback in Southern Copper's stock from its recent peak has improved its risk-reward balance, despite ongoing political concerns in Mexico.
The firm continues to favor base metal equities over iron ore stocks, pointing to supply deficits in copper, aluminum, and zinc, as well as potential catalysts such as aluminum producer Alcoa (NYSE:AA), which Morgan Stanley named its ""top pick"" for self-help initiatives and upside to consensus estimates.

Disney increased its annual cash dividend by 33% to $1 a share earlier this week. Dividends are the percentage of a company's earnings paid to shareholders as their portion of the profits. So, for investors looking to maximize their income next year, should Disney be a stock pick or are there other options out there? Here with some data is our very own Rochelle Akoufo. Rochelle, what did you find? 
Hi, Ali. So, as you mentioned there, Disney hiking its annual dividend from 75 cents to a dollar in 2025. It might not sound like much but don't sleep on it. That is per share and it adds up quickly. In fact, Nasdaq data shows dividends alone have accounted for almost 40% of stock market returns over the last 100 years. So, definitely some data to back that up. But here are three top picks for high dividend stocks to check out from our Yahoo Finance watch list. First, you have diversified holding company Icahn Enterprises LP, that's the ticker IEP. You also have ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Limited and metals and mining firm Vale SA. Now, keep in mind, these are names that most analysts see the biggest potential upside going into 2025. You'll also notice that most of these high-yield dividend picks that you see on lists, they don't tend to be from the flashiest sectors, but they are what consumers consistently need and what manufacturers produce. Think utilities, materials, health and consumer staples as well, Ali. 
So, Rochelle, how do you figure out which dividend-paying stocks are best or perhaps the most stable to invest in? 
So, there are some things to put on your checklist. Now, having a high yield can either signal an undervalued stock in the case of Disney where most analysts have a buy rating and they see some upside there or it could be from a share price tumbling which is a red flag, as they're trying to sort of get investors to stay on board. But so you have to really check the business fundamentals when it comes to this. So, check for some of these declining revenues, profits or market share as well. You also want to look for companies with a history of increasing dividends annually. That also signals stability and growth. Now, these offer a more steady and predictable income, as you mentioned, not the sexiest of names but they are steady for investors and that can help outpace inflation and economic uncertainty, especially keep in mind we have an incoming Trump administration that might shake things up in that regard. And a fun fact, I'm a bit of a nerd, a dividend aristocrat or a dividend king is a company that's increased annual dividends consistently for at least 25 years. So look at the name American Water Works. Now, that holds the record with 70 consecutive dividend increases. So make sure you look out for some of those lesser known names as well, Ali.

We recently published a list of 10 Oversold Value Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stands against the other oversold value stocks.
After Trump’s victory in the presidential election, US stocks surged to record highs. Much of the stock market’s history reveals that value stocks have outperformed their growthier counterparts but the trend has reversed over the last decade. With mega-sized technology stocks especially those driven by AI dominating, the reverse trend intensified. It is important to consider that the Morningstar US Large Growth Index has returned 258% and the Morningstar US Large Value Index has returned 148% in the last decade, reflecting a significant difference.
Growth stocks looked unstoppable until a week in July when the Morningstar growth index fell 3.97% while the value index climbed 3.39%. This was when the investors were confident about the interest rate cuts that were to be executed in the later part of the year. Thus, it looked like they shifted their focus from big tech to more underperforming sectors.
Over the next year, the outlook for value stocks looks bright as concluded by Bankrate’s quarterly Market Mavens Survey. The survey revealed that experts see value-priced equities outperforming over the next four quarters. 42% of respondents preferred value stocks to growth stock over the next year while 33% think returns will be about the same.
When leading investing professionals were asked whether value stocks or growth stocks would offer greater returns over the next year, they put forward different reasons for their preferences. While the view regarding value outperforming growth at the start of a rate-cutting cycle was noticed in the responses, one of the experts inclined towards value stocks by stating:
“If the Fed is cutting rates because the economy is faltering, market participants are apt to seek out the best growth opportunities in a weakening growth environment. However, if economic growth holds up and rates come down, value would be the place to be for the best return prospects.”
Others were of the opinion that falling inflation and interest rates would benefit both classes equally.

In order to compile a list of the 10 oversold value stocks to buy right now, we first used a stock screener to identify value stocks that have fallen by at least 30% year-to-date and are trading at a forward P/E ratio under 15, as of November 22. We focused on companies trading in industries including consumer staples, financials, legacy healthcare, industrials, and materials. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q3 data.
At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) is a global company practicing sustainable mining and has a presence in 20 countries. It was founded in 1942 as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce. Since the first ore was extracted in Itabira, Minas Gerais, the firm started working in logistics, through its railroads, ports, and terminals, in energy and in steel making. Vale operates through segments including Iron Ore Solutions and Energy Transition Metals.
Vale pioneered the world as a global mining company. The firm serves as the largest producer of iron ore, pellets, and nickel while simultaneously having operations in manganese, ferroalloys, copper, gold, silver, and cobalt. Therefore, the firm’s core business is an essential activity for the world with iron ore, nickel, and copper used in everyday life. Additionally, the firm has created a logistics network that is part of mines, railroads, ships, and ports. Other than its products, Vale carries cargo to third parties and offers two passenger train lines in Brazil thereby serving as the largest exporter of mineral abroad.
During the third quarter, operational and sales performance improved across all business segments of Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE). The firm’s iron ore production reached its highest levels in more than five years. While pellet production remains at peak since 2019, copper and nickel production is progressing well. Vale reported major business highlights, with the commissioning of the Vargem Grande 1 project’s wet processing operations started in September, completion of the joint venture transaction with Apollo, and mechanical completion achieved by the second underground mine of the Voisey’s Bay Mine Extension project.
Hence, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) has a strong foothold in mining alongside a solid logistics infrastructure integrating high-quality ore extraction and its transportation by ship, rail, and port to distribution centers. As of Q3, the stock is held by 41 hedge funds.
Overall, VALE ranks 4th on our list of oversold value stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of VALE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than VALE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Vale,2024-11-29,VALE S.A. (VALE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4e67c1bafcf1bf99e366193fe5f51556a1f72089a8c01e47b74445da1b3ecc63,"VALE (VALE) has received quite a bit of attention from Zacks.com users lately. Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Oops, something went wrong
VALE S.A. (VALE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -7.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Iron industry, which VALE falls in, has lost 10.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, VALE is expected to post earnings of $0.56 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.4% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.4%. This estimate has changed +3.4% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.01 indicates a change of -5.5% from what VALE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for VALE.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For VALE, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.76 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -17.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.7 billion and $40.28 billion estimates indicate -7.4% and +4.1% changes, respectively.
VALE reported revenues of $9.55 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.1%. EPS of $0.56 for the same period compares with $0.66 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.54%. The EPS surprise was +36.59%.
Over the last four quarters, VALE surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
VALE is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about VALE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

We recently published a list of 10 Cheapest Stocks to Buy On Robinhood. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stands against other cheapest stocks to buy on Robinhood.
While the market has been on an upward trajectory for nearly two years now, the combination of seasonal trends, strong retail, and corporate activity, and positive market momentum following the November election still suggests a potential for continued growth in U.S. equities.
Goldman Sachs’ Scott Rubner predicts a year-end rally that will push the S&P to 6,200 points as reported by Bloomberg on November 25. He attributes this potential rally to growing retail enthusiasm in equities and crypto, seasonal trading patterns, and increasing corporate buyback demand.
Rubner noted that the recent consolidation phase is typical, and highlighted significant inflows into U.S. equities, with the broader market gaining over 3% since the November 5 presidential vote and the Russell 2000 rising 6.5%. Historically, strong market performance in election years tends to extend into January, with the capital being deployed at the start of the new year.

In an interview with Seana Smith and Madison Mills of Yahoo Finance, Jim Smigiel, SEI’s Chief Investment Officer, highlighted several key insights for investors, in light of President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-growth policies. He warned that these policies could lead to higher inflation and rising interest rates, which may impact investment strategies. For investors, the focus should be on understanding how inflation and rates can affect different assets and staying prepared for potential shifts in the market.
Smigiel sees opportunities in small-cap stocks, value stocks, and financials, which are expected to benefit from the current reflationary environment. He suggested investors consider diversifying their portfolios to reduce reliance on highly concentrated growth sectors like tech. Active management, where professional fund managers select investments, could also be a useful strategy to broaden exposure and adapt to market changes.
While higher rates could eventually pose challenges, Smigiel noted that small-cap stocks remain attractive for now due to improved debt structures, providing a window of opportunity until around 2026. Investors should keep an eye on rising yields, as it might signal a need to shift toward more defensive investments. Diversification remains critical in managing risks during this period.
For this article, we checked all the large-cap companies trading on Robinhood with at least 50% positive analyst ratings. We narrowed our list to nearly 40 stocks that were trading below a forward price-to-earnings multiple of under 15. We also skipped the stocks that were trading above or at their industry median despite trading below a PE ratio of 15. Finally, we chose the 10 cheapest stocks to buy based on their average analyst price target upside as of November 25 (pre-market open). These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) is a Brazilian mining company that produces and sells iron ore, iron ore pellets, nickel, and copper both domestically and internationally. It operates through two segments: Iron Solutions, which focuses on iron ore, pellets, and related logistics, and Energy Transition Materials, which deals with nickel, copper, and by-products like gold, silver, and cobalt.
Vale S.A.’s (NYSE:VALE) stock has experienced a beat-down throughout the year and has severely underperformed the market. However, its Q3 2024 results showed strong operational performance and strategic advancements under new CEO Gustavo Pimenta, who emphasized safety, cost efficiency, portfolio optimization, and stakeholder trust as priorities for Vale’s 2030 vision.
Iron ore production hit its highest level since 2018, with pellet production increasing 13% year-over-year. The Vargem Grande project, adding 15 million tons of capacity, started ahead of schedule, while the Capanema project, 91% complete, is expected to begin operations in early 2025. The company reduced its iron ore cash costs by 17% this quarter, bringing them to $28.6 per ton, and expects to hit the low end of the $21.5-$23 guidance range for 2024.
Moreover, as discussed in our oversold blue chip stocks article, Vale (NYSE:VALE) holds a strong position in global mining, especially in iron ore production. The company’s Value-Based Management (VBM) approach is aimed at driving long-term growth, with a recent review indicating benefits that could extend into 2028 and beyond.
Analysts see Vale’s ability to generate healthy free cash flow (FCF) as key to sustaining its growth. The company’s focus on increasing production, reducing costs, and improving efficiency through VBM initiatives is expected to enhance profitability and strengthen its market position. These strategies should lead to continued earnings growth and greater shareholder value.
Overall, VALE ranks 6th on our list of cheapest stocks to buy on Robinhood. While we acknowledge the potential of VALE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VALE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of 10 Ridiculously Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stands against other ridiculously cheap stocks to buy right now.
The S&P 500 is currently trading at 23 times its forward earnings, indicative that the market is really expensive at the moment. On November 14, Alan McKnight, CIO at Regions Wealth Management, joined CNBC to share his stance on the market and his expectations moving forward.
McKnight agrees that the market is not cheap at the moment, however, this does not mean that investors halt buying. In fact, investors should continue to invest but be wary about volatility. He adds that opportunities are coming up as we head into 2025. McKnight shares that with the expectations from the economy, investors must consider broadening their portfolios. He also remains positive on small and mid-cap stocks.

Presidential elections have adjourned, and with that, new questions on the investment outlook have emerged. Investors are curious to see how the proposed tariffs on Chinese goods and all other imports impact the way markets behave moving forward. On November 22, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, joined Rachelle Akuffo on Yahoo Finance to share his expectations of the market and the investment outlook for the new presidential term.
Kleintop shares that the combined tariff claims by the newly elected government would bring the weighted average US tariff to 26%, significantly higher than its current state. He adds that while there is “reason for concern” investors do not need to make significant changes to their portfolios. He also states that currencies adjust with tariffs all the time, and since the dollar is already up by 5%, much of the impact has been mitigated.
Adding to the notion of risk mitigation, Kleintop suggests that diversification, away from popular themes in the United States, is crucial at the moment. Currently, tech and artificial intelligence hold dominance in the market, and investors must consider spreading to other avenues. He also shares that anywhere outside the United States, financials are performing extremely well and expects international stocks to grow moving forward. He adds that Europe is a bright spot where we might see an acceleration in earnings growth and price-to-earnings ratios.
He also acknowledges that AI has the potential to improve productivity, especially in areas that have been “lagging,” and shares he is interested to see how the AI market turns out. While most strategists and analysts are bullish on AI, stocks in this sector are particularly expensive relative to value stocks. That said, let’s take a look at the 10 ridiculously cheap stocks to buy right now.
To come up with the 10 ridiculously cheap stocks to buy right now, we used the Finviz Stock Screener. We set the forward P/E to 8 and under and market capitalization to $2 billion and above.

We recently published a list of 10 Best Nickel Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stands against other best nickel stocks to invest in.
Investing News Network highlighted that Nickel witnessed strong price momentum in H1 of the year as the prices took support from investor sentiment and speculation throughout commodity markets which saw a surge in prices for precious and base metals. Nickel prices remained volatile during Q3 2024 due to market speculation, Chinese stimulus, and oversupply.
Among the contributing factors was the supply of laterite nickel out of Indonesia, which led to mine curtailments in New Caledonia, Australia, and Europe. Furthermore, the increased demand for battery production in China is yet to reach the levels required to make up for the increased supply. Despite the EV sector in China showing a YoY increase of 32% during the first 9 months of 2024, the industry's nickel demand was not able to make up for shortcomings in the broader economy.
Nickel remains a critical component in NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) batteries, which are used in EVs. For the last few quarters, the market saw a significant oversupply of nickel from Asian markets, mainly from Indonesia. As per S&P Global, mined nickel production from the country saw an increase of 99,000 metric tons during Q3 2024 and is expected to be in the 2.4 million metric ton range by 2024-end, making up 57% of total global production. Despite growing demand for batteries, the oversupply situation has not been under control. This is mainly because of a weak Chinese economy.
China has been tagged as the largest consumer of nickel in the world as a majority of the metal is being used in stainless steel production. However, a difficult real estate sector and broad economic deflation impacted the demand. Investing News Network went on to say that Nickel found pricing support in September, with the Chinese government rolling out stimulus measures focused on fueling economic growth. The measures also included a 0.5% cut to the mortgages and a reduction in the downpayment to buy a home to 15% from 25%. Even though there was an initial surge in nickel prices after the package, the prices retreated once again.

Despite the challenging market conditions, Nickel’s long-term demand in the EV industry is robust. According to EV Magazine, as automakers prioritize the high-nickel battery chemistries because of range and performance advantages, nickel consumption should be fueled as a result of the global shift toward electrification.
As per Benchmark estimates, the battery nickel demand is expected to triple by the year 2030. Mid and high-level performance EVs are expected to fuel the growth of battery nickel demand in the coming years, mainly in Western markets. Benchmark projections demonstrate that nickel-based chemistries will capture 85% of battery cell production capacity outside of China by the year 2030. The batteries should make up for more than 50% of nickel demand growth by 2030, touching 1.5 million tonnes of nickel demand by the decade's end.
In order to compile a list of the 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now, we utilized stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies with the highest market caps.

The 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024.
At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Average Upside Potential: 47%
Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)  is engaged in producing and selling iron ore, iron ore pellets, nickel, and copper in Brazil and internationally.
Wall Street analysts opine that Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)’s Iron Solutions segment should fuel its long-term growth. In Q3 2024, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) achieved its highest iron ore production since 2018 and has also increased its 2024 production guidance to the upper end of the 323 to 330 million tons range. Also, the company’s C1 cash costs in iron ore declined by 17% QoQ and 6% YoY.
Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) plans to accelerate the execution of its premium iron ore strategy, leveraging on its unique endowment. The company possesses one of the richest iron ore resources in the world, and it aims to structurally produce ~350 million tons of iron ore. Out of this, 80% - 90% will be high-quality products, such as BRBF, Carajás, and agglomerated products. This flexible portfolio should enable Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) to support its clients in their decarbonization journey.
Also, the company remains focused on driving its nickel business. GEM Co., a Chinese battery-metal producer, and Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)’s Indonesian unit signed an agreement to establish a $1.42 billion nickel plant in the Southeast Asian nation, highlighting the country’s drive to boost processing. Industry experts remain optimistic about this development as Indonesia makes up for over half of global nickel production. The country has been seeking overseas investment in its processing industry to tap the increasing demand for EV batteries.
Wall Street analysts have an average price target of $15.39 on the shares of Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE).
Overall, VALE ranks 2nd on our list of  best nickel stocks to invest in according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of VALE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently published a list of 10 Best Materials Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stands against other best materials stocks.
As the uncertainty about the US Presidential election faded, market experts are now looking for the sectors expected to benefit from the re-election of President Trump.  Donald Trump’s policies on housing, targeting federal lands and reducing regulatory barriers, demonstrate ambitious plans to fuel construction and housing availability, reported Fastmarkets.
Trump’s stance on immigration might also impact the pallet sector. A fall in immigration and expected deportations might result in a tightening of the labor market and wage pressures. Therefore, Fastmarkets reported that there might be a reacceleration in wage growth. That being said, huge deportations might be restricted as business leaders can oppose these regulations due to expectations of labor shortages and higher costs. Therefore, any policy changes might be moderated.
Strategists at Bank of America are optimistic about the materials sector. This optimism stems from the expectation of an earnings rebound after the US Fed’s rate-cutting cycle in September. The strategists also pointed out significant underinvestment in manufacturing, including fields such as mining and equipment replacement. They believe that robust decarbonization goals are expected to aid metals, mining, and commodities.
The large bank also cited China’s stimulus program, highlighting that the materials sector had the highest correlation when it comes to the S&P 500’s 11 sectors to the MSCI China Index. Moreover, Wall Street experts opine that the return of Trump’s Presidency is expected to fuel growth momentum for construction, infrastructure, domestic manufacturing, and industrial sectors.
Montgomery Investment Management believes that Trump’s focus on rebuilding America’s infrastructure should result in elevated government spending, which should aid construction companies and materials suppliers. Also, policies that target bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., such as tariffs on imported goods, should support domestic manufacturing companies.

As per JLL, the US construction industry is well-placed for a year of measured growth and adaptation in 2025. The company believes that the push for green building practices from local governments and client directives, together with energy efficiency and lower carbon footprints, should continue to shape project requirements.
Also, improvements in the integration of advanced technologies including AI, IoT, and digital twins have been reshaping design, construction, and building management. This should provide opportunities for increased efficiency and value. JLL added that the US construction industry appears to be well-placed for growth and maintaining the right balance between short-term operational efficiency with long-term goals, while adapting to evolving organizational needs and technological advancements, remains crucial.

To list the 10 Best Materials Stocks to Buy Right Now, we used a screener and sifted through several online rankings to extract the companies operating in the materials sector. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their average upside potential, as of November 14.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Average Upside Potential: 47.5%
Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) is engaged in producing and selling iron ore, iron ore pellets, nickel, and copper in Brazil and internationally.
Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) continues to implement a Value-Based Management (VBM) approach in a bid to optimize its operations and enhance shareholder value. The VBM vision demonstrates potential benefits to production and unit costs extending into 2028 and beyond. Wall Street analysts believe that such improvements should increase Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)’s net present value. The company’s strategic vision for 2030 focuses on a performance-driven culture, premium product portfolio, and stakeholder trust. Precisely, the company’s long-term growth should stem from cost optimization.
Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)’s management remains optimistic about its cost efficiency, targeting to reach sub-$20 cash costs by 2026, and it remains confident in the long-term potential of the nickel sector. It also plans to increase iron ore capacity to 350 million tons and further enhance copper production. Industry experts believe that Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) remains well-positioned to capitalize on any improvements in iron ore prices or higher global demand.
This means that elevated production volumes should result in economies of scale, potentially reducing per-unit costs and improving overall profitability. During increased demand or supply constraints from other producers, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) can potentially capture a larger market share and benefit from price premiums.
In Q3 2024, the company’s operational and sales performance saw an improvement throughout the business segments. Notably, the iron ore shipments rose by 1.3 Mt (or 2%) YoY, courtesy of an 18% increase in pellet sales because of higher production and strong demand.
As per Wall Street analysts, the shares of Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) have an average price target of $15.39.
Overall, VALE ranks 2nd on our list of 10 Best Materials Stocks to Buy Right Now.

Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","Oops, something went wrong
VALE S.A. (VALE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -8.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Iron industry, which VALE falls in, has lost 7.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
VALE is expected to post earnings of $0.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.8%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.6%. This estimate has changed -4% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.01 indicates a change of -2.1% from what VALE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.3%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for VALE.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of VALE, the consensus sales estimate of $10.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -19.2%. The $38.48 billion and $40.71 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -7.9% and +5.8%, respectively.
VALE reported revenues of $9.55 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.1%. EPS of $0.56 for the same period compares with $0.66 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.54%. The EPS surprise was +36.59%.
Over the last four quarters, VALE surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
VALE is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about VALE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Oversold Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stands against other oversold blue chip stocks.
Market experts believe that, so far, 2024 continues to be a strong year for the broader stock market. With the predictions of rate cuts, some strategists opine that next year can be another year for the equities. On a YTD basis, the S&P 500 saw an increase of over ~22%. On a related note, Fidelity Investments (in the note dated October 16, 2024) highlighted that equities rallied in Q3 2024, courtesy of real estate, US value, and some small-cap stocks. While volatility increased in August, it decreased later. This led to a productive September.
Fidelity Investments went on to say that the US labor market demonstrated signs of cooling. However, it remained strong overall. Despite some softness in manufacturing, some of the major global economies continued to expand. Elsewhere, in China, new policies to fuel stock prices were rolled out. While the positive impact was seen in the Chinese equities post the stimulus measures, there remains some uncertainty regarding the long-term impact.
With 2024 approaching an end, global investors continue to wonder about the factors that might influence the broader financial markets in 2025. The markets are intertwined, making US stocks more sensitive to several factors. Forbes reported that the results of the 2024 presidential election, domestic inflation and rates, technology innovation, economic trends, and elevated geopolitical tensions are some of the factors likely to influence the financial markets
As per TradingBlock, the tariff measures, together with a national deficit, are some of the critical issues for the next president. While the new tariffs can slow down the broader US economy, the deficit, if left unchecked, might lead to continued devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Also, a slowdown of the US economy might result in inflation worries.
Some market experts continue to worry about the Chinese economy. As per SALT Venture Group, the slowness in China can be a constraint for the stock market growth in the next year. This is because this slowdown can weaken the demand for US exports. As per CEIC, the US total exports to China sat at ~$12.618 billion in August 2024.

Forbes reported that experts are predicting stock market growth to vary in the range of a 5% decline to growth of 20% in 2025. However, some experts believe that a 10% increase is expected to be the most likely scenario. UBS expects that the stock market is on track for another year of double-digit gains. The strategists made a bullish call for stocks, projecting that the S&P 500 is expected to touch 6,600 by next year’s end. The firm went on to add that the increase is expected to be aided by a “no landing” for the economy.
The improved US macroeconomic outlook has increased the bank’s degree of certainty about the positive view of equities. Notably, the job market continues to be resilient amidst tighter financial conditions and elevated interest rates. Investors might witness some volatility because of the November election, but it’s unlikely that it will be a hurdle to more positive market drivers.

E Gustavo Pimenta. Sir, you may now begin.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Vale's third-quarter 2024 conference call. I'm pleased to present Vale's result for the first time as the company's CEO. Before I start, I would like to take a moment to thank Eduardo Bartolomeo for his tenure as CEO of Vale in the last five years. Eduardo led Vale through one of the most difficult periods of our history.
It drove a series of significant changes within the company, and today, we are in a much stronger position, being safer, more stable, and better prepared for an even greater future. So on behalf of the entire Vale team, we thank you, Eduardo, for that. I also want to express my gratitude to the board of directors for their trust and confidence. It is an honor for me to lead this great company.
And I'm highly confident and optimistic about our future. So in my initial weeks as CEO, I have outlined the key areas of focus that would guide us going forward. Vale has an immense potential, and I firmly believe that we can position ourselves as a reference in the sector. For that, we are building on our solid progress to develop a Vale 2030 vision, which we plan on detailing at Vale Day, in early December.
This vision will be based on three key pillars. First, a performance-driven culture; we will accelerate our cultural transformation, maintaining our focus on safety and operational excellence, while also becoming a more agile, efficient organization. As such, we'll be taking decisive actions to maturely improve our competitiveness and once again position Vale in the very low end of the industry global cost curve. We will provide more details about our cost-efficiency initiatives and associated targets at Vale Day.
Second, a superior portfolio; we will accelerate the execution of our premium iron ore strategy, leveraging on our unique endowment. Vale has one of the richest iron ore resources in the world, and we aim to structurally produce about 350 million tons of iron ore. Of which 80% to 90% will be high-quality products, like BRBF, Carajas, and agglomerated products. This flexible portfolio will allow us to support our clients in their decarbonization journey while maintaining optionality to capture value under different market conditions.
We also have a very unique base metals platform, with significant growth potential, particularly in copper. I'm very pleased with our strategic decision to carve out the business last year, and have a world-class dedicated team under the leadership of Shaun. I'm highly confident we will take this business to next level in the following years. Third, it is essential that our stakeholder sees us as a trusted partner.
For that, we will be working closely with society to leave a positive legacy from our activities, while creating responsible and trustworthy relationships. This will be a critical priority of mine and my leadership team, and I'm certain it will give us a competitive advantage going forward. We are working as a team to detail what each one of these levers mean in terms of concrete goals, targets, and initiatives. And we'll be providing the details at Vale Day.
Now, let's take a look at our recent performance in the next slides. We are making steady progress on our commitment to eliminate upstream dams in Brazil. Our decharacterization program includes 30 structures. And this month, we achieved another important milestone by eliminating the 16th structure, Dique 1A, on October 11th, about two months ahead of schedule.
The dam elimination process requires a lot of innovation, and it is complex and unique for each structure. We have gained incredible experience and knowledge through this process, and this has allowed us to accelerate the decharacterization of many structures, while upholding the highest standards of safety and risk management. We will continue to deliver on our dam safety commitments with a disciplined approach. Alongside the decommissioning process, we are working to enhance the safety of our structures.
The chart on the next slide shows our progress on removing dams from emergency levels. In August, we removed the Sul Superior Dam from the emergency level 3. And currently, there is just one dam left at this level, which is the Forquilha III Dam. And we are making very good progress to reduce this dam's emergency levels soon, being on track to deliver on our commitment to have no dams at level 3 by 2025.
The future of mining will require companies to reduce its footprint and minimize even further the impact of their operations. At Vale, we have been working on a series of initiatives to create more secular operations, such as our Gelado plant in Carajas, which will be able to produce up to 5 million tons per year of high-quality iron ore by reprocessing existing tailings. Other initiatives include processing waste from piles and generating co-products for other industries. In addition to minimizing the impact of our operations, these initiatives usually have quicker time to market and lower unit costs once they reach scale.
Now, let's talk about the performance of our portfolio in the next slide. This quarter we delivered the highest iron ore production since 2018, underscoring our focus on operational excellence. Aligned with our strategy to grow on agglomerated products, our pellet production reached its highest level for any quarter since 2019, increasing 13% year on year. Last month, we increased our production guidance for the year.
And we are now confident we can deliver at the top end of the 323 to 330 million tons range for 2024. Iron ore sales in the quarter were in line year on year, with an important quality improvement in our product mix on the back of higher BRBF sales and the proactive decision to reduce direct sales of high silica ore. Delivering on our growth projects in iron ore is critical for us to improve the flexibility of our portfolio. To that end, I'm very pleased to see the successful start-up of Vargem Grande within budget and one month ahead of schedule.
This is a 15 million tons iron ore project, which should also increase iron ore content by about 2% at the site. The next relevant project to come online is Capanema, with another 15 million tons. The project is already 91% complete. And it is scheduled to start up in the first half of 2025.
This demonstrates that we are effectively delivering on our commitments. Regaining not only volumes but more importantly commercial flexibility, which will help us maximize value creation. Looking at our Energy Transition Metals business, we also saw a strong production performance year on year in both copper and nickel, as the asset review initiatives started generating results. Ore processed at Salobo 1 and 2 plants increased by 30% year on year.
And, our Sudbury mines had a 20% increase in mill throughput year on year. Shaun Usmar has recently joined as VBM, CEO, and will continue the implementation of the asset review and execution of the company's long-term strategy. I'm confident we have the best team in place to take the Energy Transition Metals business to the next level. Last but not least, after two years of negotiation, today marks an important chapter in our history.
We signed the binding terms for the full reparation of Samarco's Fundão dam collapse. The terms agreed is a result of open dialogue based on social, environmental, and technical criteria, and reinforces Vale's commitment to a fair and definitive reparation. The total value of the agreement is BRL 170 billion, which will be divided into BRL 100 billion in cash payments payable over 20 years to the federal government, the states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, and the municipalities to fund compensatory programs and actions tied to the public policies. Plus, BRL 32 billion in obligations to be performed by Samarco over the next years, including ongoing programs for individual indemnification, resettlement, and environmental recovery, which will be gradually transferred from the Renova Foundation.
The total amount also considers the BRL 38 billion already disbursed in 42 compensation programs over the years. Together with all the key stakeholders, we reached a mutually beneficial solution for all parties, especially for the impacted people, communities, and the environment while creating definitiveness and legal certainty for the companies. Now, I'd like to invite Murilo Muller, our acting CFO, to talk about our financial performance. Please, Murilo. 
Murilo Muller -- Interim Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations
Thanks, Gustavo, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here to present our third-quarter 2024 results. So let's start with our EBITDA performance. As you can see, our pro forma EBITDA reached $3.7 billion in the quarter, with some encouraging factors that helped mitigate the impact of lower iron ore prices.
In Q3 2024, we achieved higher sales volumes, particularly in pellets, our highest-quality product. We also delivered a much better performance on costs and expenses, while the weaker Brazilian Real provided further support. As Gustavo mentioned earlier, we are extremely focused on regaining our competitiveness and our C1 cost performance is particularly important in this journey. Let's take a closer look at our C1 in the next slides.
In Iron ore, our C1 cash costs, excluding third-party purchase, was $28.6 per ton, 17% lower quarter on quarter, and 6% lower year on year. We were pleased to see that this is the first year-on-year decrease in C1 cash costs since the first quarter of 2021, giving us confidence that we are on the right path to becoming a more efficient company. The sequential improvement was driven by the results of our efficiency initiatives, lower maintenance expenses, fixed cost dilution, as well as a better production mix, with more volumes come from the Northern System where we have our most competitive operations. We are highly confident in delivering our C1 cost guidance for 2024 of $21.5 to $23 per ton.
More than that, our performance is actually pointing toward us achieving the low end of this guidance in 2024. In Q4, we expect sequentially lower costs. For reference, our C1 in September reached $18.2 per ton, excluding inventory effects. Now, moving to the energy transition metal business, we observed an overall decrease in our all-in costs year on year.
In copper, the 13% year-on-year reduction was driven by higher unit by-product revenues and lower unit costs, resulting in an all-in below $3,000 per ton. As a result of this solid performance, in Q3, we are once again revising our 2024 all-in cost guidance downwards, with the new range being now between $2,900 and $3,300 per ton. In nickel, despite the consolidation of PTVI operations, which have lower average costs, all-in costs decreased by 3% year on year. We remain on track to meet our cost guidance for 2024.
This improvement was a result of the ongoing ramp up of Voisey's Bay operations, which allowed us to reduce third-party purchase in our Canadian refineries, coupled with higher unit by-product revenues. Now, moving on to cash generation, free cash flow generation was $0.2 billion, mostly impacted by lower EBITDA and by negative working capital. We saw an increase in accounts receivables due to 14 million tons of iron ore sales accrued in the end of the quarter, as well as 23 million tons of sales that were booked at a forward price of $109 per ton. Our capital expenditures remain steady quarter on quarter at $1.3 billion, trading below our guidance for 2024 of approximately $6.5 billion.
Lastly, our free cash flow generation and strong cash position were primarily used to return value to our shareholders with the payment of $1.6 billion in interest on capital in September. In Q3, we also acquired the remaining stake in Aliança Energia. As we have previously mentioned, our intention is to look for potential partners for our energy assets, while keeping a minority stake. We hope to be able to bring more news on this in the coming months.
Before passing the floor back to Gustavo for the key takeaways, I would like to comment on the agreement we signed today. As Gustavo mentioned in his opening remarks, the agreement outlines the reparation and compensation measures related to the Samarco dam collapse. In addition to the BRL 38 billion disbursed since 2015, the agreement establishes BRL 100 billion in payment obligations over a period of 20 years and BRL 32 billion in performance obligations by Samarco, including initiatives for individual identification, resettlement, and environmental recovery. This table outlines our expectations of cash commitments.
As you can see, in the short term, we will have a higher concentration of obligations to perform, and over time, the impact on cash will gradually reduce. This cash outflow projection considers that Samarco will continue to pay for a portion of the requirement payments as per its approved business plan. As such, we have recognized an extra provision of approximately $1 billion, bringing our expanded net debt to $16.5 billion. Regarding our optimal leverage targets, we are maintaining the $10 billion to $20 billion range under the same expanded net debt concepts.
Now, I pass the floor to Gustavo.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Murilo. Before opening up for the Q&A session, I would like to reinforce the key messages from today's call. We remain highly focused on safety and operational excellence. As you have seen, we delivered a robust operational performance; the fourth consecutive quarter with a year-on-year increase in iron ore production.
We are accelerating our cost efficiency program, now expecting to reach the low end of our C1 guidance range for the year in iron ore, while lowering, once again, our all-in cost guidance for copper. I can assure you we will laser focused on our efficiency efforts in the years to come. On our strategic objectives to deliver a superior portfolio, we are progressing with our transformational projects. Vargem Grande started up in September on budget and ahead of schedule.
Capanema will come online in the next months, providing us with further flexibility within our iron ore operations at a very low capital intensity. At VBM, the asset review execution is gradually bearing fruit with strong year-on-year operational performance at both copper and nickel. And I'm very confident that, under Shaun's leadership, we will continue to make substantial progress toward creating a leading energy transition metals business. Finally, today is an important day for Brazil, for Vale, and for the people impacted by the collapse of Samarco Dam in Mariana.
The signing of definitive settlement for full reparation confirms that the Brazilian institutions are solid, competent, and legitimate for resolving our issues. The agreement also reinforces our commitment to the people, the communities, and the environment. Thank you all. And let's start the Q&A session.

[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Rodolfo Angele with J.P. Morgan. You can open your microphone.
Rodolfo Angele -- Analyst
OK. Good afternoon, everyone, first of all. My first question goes to Gustavo and Gustavo, I couldn't not start by wishing you the best of luck in your tenure as the CEO. My question is, you touched on a few points around your ambitions as the new leader of the company in the beginning of the call.
And I understand that more details will be provided at the Vale Day, but I wonder if you could discuss with us a little bit more of what are your short-term focus will be, which initiative you see that could represent the biggest opportunities to be captured, especially in the lower -- or in the earlier part of your tenure. So that's my first question. And my second question, I also couldn't not take the opportunity to ask a question to Rogerio, great to hear from you, I wanted to hear from you a little bit more on the portfolio strategy for iron ore that we're starting to hear more about. So can you give us more details on what exactly do you expect to be the next steps in that direction, what is the evolution of the portfolio of iron ore Vale in the future? And that's it for me, thank you very much.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Rodolfo. Gustavo here. Thanks for the best wishes. Yes, look, I think the way we are thinking about is under three key levers.
One, in terms of portfolio, we've talked about it, but we are pushing hard to be able to resume the capacity that we think we can add in a very accretive way to our iron ore portfolio, getting it to 350 million tons, which will give us, more than the volumes, it will give us flexibility to operate under different market conditions, plus growing VBM, especially going in copper, right. So one of the key mandates that Shaun has is how can we bring copper volumes sooner, especially given the endowment that Vale has. So that is going to be a key element of our strategy. And we will push that agenda forward in a very decisive way.
The other one which is super important, and you've seen some of it already in this quarter, is to really drive a performance-oriented culture within Vale, right? So we appreciated -- we lost to some competitiveness over the last years as a result of many things, including some of the constraints we had in our operations. But I'm very optimistic we'll be able to drive the company back into a much more competitive environment, lowering our C1, we talked about that, right, lowering our C1 below $20. So we will push that agenda forward. And I'm very optimistic about our ability to deliver on that.
And the third one, which is probably a more short-term focus is how can we continue to build strong and trustworthy relationships with the several stakeholders that we have. And I'm very happy with the solution that we just announced the settlement of Mariana is an element toward that future. So I'm being very focused on resolving those issues because we know they weighed on the stock, and we're working very hard to resolve them. So that agenda is going to be super important for me, for my leadership team, so we can bring the key stakeholders along our journey.
So with that, I'll pass to Rogerio to go on the commercial strategy.
Rogerio Nogueira -- Interim Executive Vice President, Iron Ore Solutions
Hello, Rodolfo. Good to hear from you. I guess when we talk about portfolio strategy, we should divide it in short-term and long-term. I guess in the short term, we will focus more on optimizing our project -- our product portfolio and in maximizing value.
In the long term, it has to do a lot with the decarbonization of the steel industry, and how we position ourselves to be so the primary supplier for the decarbonized steelmaking industry or the steel industry. And then, I think I'd like to highlight that when you talk about portfolio optimization in the short term, we talk a lot about iron ore premiums. And as you know it; our premiums depend a lot on steel margins, which are currently low. But based on our market outlook, we believe that there is a potential upside.
But I think, more than that, we believe that we do have a lot of action in terms of product portfolio. And what we're trying to do and trying to build is a portfolio which is flexible, that we can adjust to maximize value. I think, here, it is important that we make it clear that our objective function is value maximization. More specifically, I think understanding, for example, the total balance of Fe content, silica, alumina -- alumina to silica ratio in the global market is going to be fundamental for quick portfolio adjustment.
Just to give an example, as of today, we have very high silica penalties at $4.70 per ton for every -- each percentage point of silica. So we would like, for example, to work and reduce our offering of high-silica products, and then reduce that kind of impact. Not only that, but we also may take advantage of our higher production of high-quality pellet feed from Brucutu, Vargem Grande wet processing, and more production from Carajas. Ultimately, I think we believe that the understanding of the global market combined with our flexibility is going to allow us to optimize, maximize value in the short term.
So we are very much driven by our value maximization and our flexible product portfolio.

Our next question comes from Daniel Sasson with Itau BBA. You can open your microphone.
Daniel Sasson -- Itau BBA -- Analyst
Thank you. Thank you so much, everyone. Good luck on your new role, Gustavo. It's also good to hear you again, Rogerio.
My first question would be related to the, and first of all, first and foremost, congratulations on signing the agreement for the resettlement agreement for Samarco, definitely a win-win situation for the populations and for Vale that can move ahead from this chapter. In regards to that, I'd like to know your perceptions, Gustavo, if anything has changed at all in regards to the discussions ongoing in the U.K. and the Netherlands related to the legal proceedings going on related to Samarco, if you could give us an update on that and also on the talks with the government related to the renewal of the railway concessions, I think that would be great. And maybe my second question would be related to your expanded net debt target, the $10 billion to $20 billion target was set at a different time for value, right? A lot of other things that were going on, but maybe now that you will have a clearer view on your disbursements for Mariana, for instance, over the next years, if you could think about changing that target, if it makes sense at all to even discuss that, or if you remain comfortable with your $10 billion to $20 billion expended on that target for the time being? Thank you so much.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Daniel. So let me go over a couple items of your question and then probably send to Alex to complement, especially the U.K. case. So the decision today and the signing of the agreement today is an important step and we always believed, and I think today we are able to validate that that the right jurisdiction for the settlement was in Brazil and we are able to successfully achieve that.
So we think that that is the right jurisdiction and where the decision needs to be hold and delivered. So we are happy with the outcome that we're able to achieve today. I'll ask Alex after my answer here to also compliment if I missed anything. On the renewal, the concession renewal, we have advanced, as we've mentioned before, a lot on the potential agreement with the government, with the potential settlement.
I'm optimistic we'll be able to finalize that item as well. There're some internal procedures and legal procedures that needs to be followed. So we are hopeful that by year-end we'll be able to resolve that discussion. And finally, on the expanded net debt concept, I think it's early for us to revisit.
I think the concept as designed served us well and I think it was the right one. So for now we are keeping and you can always revisit, but today we think that's the right metric and the right range for us to operate under. So I'll ask Alex to compliment my answer on the U.K. case, Alex, please.
Alexandre Silva D'Ambrosio -- Executive Vice President, Corporate and External Affairs
Thank you, Gustavo, and thank you, Daniel, for the question. Let's start by speaking about the U.K. case. The trial on the U.K.
case started last week, many people are aware of that and it is ongoing for the next few weeks. The U.K. trial deals with compensation for individuals, but that issue itself will only be discussed next year, so it is a long discussion still about whether BHP holding can be liable for Samarco. So that is a discussion underway.
Now, the issues that are being discussed about compensation in the U.K. that will be discussed about compensation are fully covered by the Brazil settlement that we signed today and for that reason we understand that the position for the defendants will be much strengthen in U.K. also not only because the claimants will have a streamlined settlement option in the Brazil agreement, but mostly because the Brazil agreement deconstructs the lawyers' principal argument in the U.K., which is that these types of issues are not readily resolved in Brazil. And this has just -- the agreement disproves that point and proves that in fact resolution is possible and it's efficient and fast.
The Netherlands claim as you mentioned that will only begin in the middle of next year. The first hearings in court will be in the next year and the issue of whether there is jurisdiction over Vale has yet to be addressed. So that is really far along the road. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Leonardo Correa with BTG. You can open your microphone.
Leonardo Correa -- BTG Pactual -- Analyst
Good afternoon, everyone. So a couple of questions on my side, the first one on cash costs for INR, clearly significant progress, right, over the past quarters. The message is that you guys are confident in reaching a low angle of guidance at $21. And Gustavo, you mentioned in your introduction that you're confident of reaching sub $20 going forward.
Just to try to get a bit of your sense, I mean, is this possible already in 2025? I mean, you have a series of initiatives. You also have volume gradually ramping up, a bit more volumes. So I just wanted to hear you on that front if those targets are achievable in 2025. My second question on nickel, right, specifically on the Energy Transition business, there clearly is a dual speed happening, right? I mean, copper, which is the focus, which needs to be the focus, super bright long term.
I think every single mine in the world is super bullish on copper, rightfully so, right? I mean, it is warranted. On the nickel side of the business, I mean, clearly there's a tone down from Vale, at least in my view, in my perception, over the last quarters. Nickel prices haven't been helping, of course, but in this environment where EBITDA is negative on some lines and clearly there is room for some streamlining. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on what exactly you guys are thinking for nickel and whether capacity cuts are on the decks here considering this pressured environment.
Thank you.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Leo. So I will do the first one and a little bit of the second one, but I also want to have Shaun and take the benefit of having Shaun on the line for him to also talk about the nickel one. Look, in terms of cost, what I meant of coming below 20 is by 2026, which is that prior guidance we have given. The more I look into our cost base, the more confident I get on our ability to get to that point.
And as I mentioned, this is going to be a key priority of mine. The one thing we have to appreciate is, there are several levers to get us to a more efficient position. One is, in the last couple of years, we've introduced a series of processes or new processes to deal with restrictions that we had in our operations. So the team today knows a lot more about how to manage those processes than they use it to do.
And that is, we are seeing a lot of improvements in our ability to remove costs from the system just by operating better, right? There is the benefit of ramping up production. We just reset guidance to 323 to 330, but we've said we want to get to 350 with higher quality and some volume coming from the north. That also helps us to drive the unit cost down. Plus, the regular efficient programs that we've been pursuing and it is getting more and more mature by the day.
That is what makes me feel confident and we are seeing some of it this year. We have pointed to the low end of the C1 guidance, which just I think highlights that we are on the right track. On nickel, look, we continue to believe that nickel is critical for the Energy Transition and has a space on that. Certainly, we have to make sure we have the right portfolio of nickel given market conditions and be as efficient as possible to navigate and be profitable through the cycle, right, that's one of the key mandates that Shaun has, but I'll stop here, I'd love to hear also his thoughts about it.
Shaun Usmar -- Chief Executive Officer, Vale Base Metals
Sure, thanks. And Leonardo, thanks for the question. You have the distinction of being my first value-based metals question on an earnings call, so thanks. Gustavo has touched on the high points and I think, we've just gone through a quarterly high from a unit cost perspective with some of the maintenance on -- in Sudbury, which was scheduled.
You would have seen a lot of significant investment that has been occurring in this space. And some of the initiatives that have been put in place across the business from a productivity point of view with Mark Cutifani and the management team, which we're seeing bearing fruit, 20 to 30% productivity improvements, lots of opportunity for fixed cost dilution. And so, this is a long-term capital deployment business. We're seeing roughly 40% of the cost curve at the moment underwater.
And, you are seeing supply being curtailed in certain areas. At the end of the day, we have a strategically significant business, particularly from a Western lens, which has probably one of the best mineral endowments I've seen in my career. It is underexplored, underutilized. And I think the opportunity for us to allocate capital wisely while doing a lot more to continue to drive cost reductions, productivity improvements, and maximize value for this business through the cycle is really what the priority looks like.
And we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that really what we're talking about, we talk about nickel, but the vast portion of this -- of this particular part of the portfolio is polymetallic. We've got a lot of gold in PGMs. Gold is at record prices, more or less. And so, I think for this -- this phenomenon to continue and for us to unlock value, particularly at this point in the cycle, is really the focus for us.
And I think beyond this, there's a huge amount of underappreciated optionality as we look at this portfolio. And that's our job to do, is really to unlock that and reveal that to the market. So I hope that answers your question.
Operator
Can we move on to the next question, Mr. Gustavo? Our next question comes from Caio Ribeiro with Bank of America. You can open your microphone.
Caio Ribeiro -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Great. Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. So my first question is on cash return perspectives ahead, right? With the final agreement related to Mariana, the company still has its expanded net debt below $20 billion.
Yet, the obligations of disbursement related to Mariana, Brumadinho, decharacterization, they amount to nearly $3.7 billion over 2025, which reduce in a material way the company's free cash flow generation potential for that year, right? And I know that from an expanded net debt perspective, the disbursements related to Mariana and Brumadinho should in theory be neutral, right? As you're disbursing the cash to cover those obligations, yet as you disburse those amounts, you reduce your provisioned amount, which is reflected in your expanded net debt, right? Yet, if you look at it solely from a free cash flow perspective, there is a cash disbursement related to those items that reduces the free cash flow yield which the company ultimately can deliver. So my question is, will you look solely to your expanded net debt level in an isolated manner to determine whether you can announce or you announced an extraordinary dividend ahead, or will you also look at that free cash flow yield incorporating those obligations related to Mariana, Brumadinho, and decharacterization to make that decision, right? And then a second question on a different topic here. Vale had the JV structure with Ero Copper, the Furnas project, which depends on exploratory success. And you also have that fund that was recently established to develop further these types of partnerships.
So my question is, other than for copper assets, could you use that model of partnerships JVs for iron ore as well within Brazil? Thank you.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
OK. Starting with the expanded net debt concept, right? Look, in fact, we always look at the free cash flow projection for the company under different scenarios to make that assessment. And then, judge how we allocate our cap, right? So the net debt or the expanded net debt concept is one of the elements, but we look into others, and we look at, especially to your point, where the expected cash flow generation of the company is vis-a-vis the commitments we have. And if we have an opportunity to remunerate our shareholders, we'll do as we've been doing over the years.
So that is the way we look at several variables before making those decisions, not only one. In terms of partnerships and funds, those ones are transactions where we can accelerate our access to offtake and volume, where it makes sense for Vale to instead of doing ourselves, having someone to do, and we benefit from that partnership. In many of the case, or most of the other cases, we do ourselves, especially in VBM. On iron ore, I think there is less of that opportunity.
I think you've seen us doing some of the -- we call them, mini minas; mini mines, as those are small mines where we don't think we are as competitive as our competitors to develop. And therefore, we pursue some sort of commercial agreement with them to be able to have access to those volumes, especially higher quality materials. So we will continue to think about that one. But I would say it's probably under a different format as compared to the way we look at base metals.

Next question, from Rafael Barcellos with Bradesco BBI. You can open your microphone.
Rafael Barcellos -- Bradesco BBI -- Analyst
Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. And, of course, good luck, Gustavo. Congratulations for the results and for the definitive settlement.
Also, Rogerio, good to hear from you again. And then my first question, Gustavo, could you please share with us your thoughts on how the regulatory environment for mining activity in Brazil is evolving? Other than that, how are the discussions related to a new cave decree in Brazil or even the modernization of these cave regulation and, of course, whether you believe that it could happen in the coming years? And then my second question is about the base metals vision, as this is the -- Shaun -- first conference call at Vale, Shaun, good luck. So Shaun, if you could share with us your first impressions, the many opportunities that you see at Vale Base Metals, I mean it could be very interesting? Thank you.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Rafael. So let me do the first one, and then Shaun can step in. Look, as you know, Brazil has an enormous potential in terms of mineral potential, right? Not only by having the highest quality iron ore in the planet, but also by having a lot of deposits for our Energy Transition Metals commodities, right. So in our push, and our discussion has been how can we accelerate those development as a country.
And many of those require discussion and modernization, for example, as you've mentioned on the cave decree, right, and the legislation of it. I'm optimistic that we'll be able to advance on those discussions. I think there is a recognition that the current legislation can be improved by all parties. And we are hopeful that this is going to be addressed in the near future, hopefully, sooner rather than later.
And that will be fundamental for us to unlock the potential that we have in the country, and the potential that Vale has to grow on those commodities. So I'll pass to Shaun for the second question. Shaun, we can't hear you. I don't know if you are speaking.
Shaun Usmar -- Chief Executive Officer, Vale Base Metals
Are you able to hear me?
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes, we can hear you now.
Shaun Usmar -- Chief Executive Officer, Vale Base Metals
OK. Thank you. Rafael, thank you. Look, the vision after three-and-a-half weeks, I think, is very similar to the reason I took on this opportunity with the Vale Base Metals, which is honestly, I believe, that it's probably one of the most underappreciated assets of its kind in the battery metals or energy metals space.
If you're building a business like this, one of the biggest barriers that people or organizations face is ultimately the mineral endowment. It all starts with the geology. I spent three days with the GMs and some of the business leaders last week, and I'd say that I walked away from that time -- actually it exceeded my most optimistic assumptions on the potential. And I think therein lines the opportunity for us as we look to allocate capital and run this business as efficiently as we can.
Now, Gustavo has already pointed out that, particularly in Brazil, everybody loves copper. It's very difficult to find high-quality copper assets. This business has an underappreciated and incredible mineral endowments in Brazil. And even prior to this call, we're working already with the team trying to see, if we remove the constraints, what's our ability to be able to actually unlock and partnership the opportunities with government and other stakeholders that mineral potential.
We've got the established businesses like Salobo and Sossego. Salobo has opened at depth and open in various directions. And then we've got so many other opportunities in that particular district to embark upon looking at hubs, and other things to unlock some of that mineral wealth. And so, I guess for me, as we look at it this time, in a business where people are trying to buy what we've got, our chance is to really unlock the productivity cost and other things that are within our control, and ultimately unlock the value in the longer term that exists in this portfolio, and then go beyond that once we've been able to achieve that.
I think we really have the foundation to create a true sector leader in time.

Our next question comes from Marina Calero with RBC. You can open your microphone.
Marina Calero -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thanks for the call. I have a follow-up question on your corporate strategy. Is it fair to assume that you are focused on your internal growth opportunities? Or would you be open to grow inorganically as well?
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Marina. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead, Shaun.
Shaun Usmar -- Chief Executive Officer, Vale Base Metals
No, no, apologies, Gustavo. Go for it.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
No, go ahead. Go ahead.
Shaun Usmar -- Chief Executive Officer, Vale Base Metals
Yes, Marina. Thanks. Look, I come out of businesses like Estrada that essentially grew through M&A, and I've spent a large part of my career doing M&A. When I look at the M&A landscape, every business has to have their capability and always look at different times of the cycle through a make or buy lens.
But I think just going back to my earlier answer, our biggest and most valuable opportunity is the one that we actually have. And so, I think, certainly for the foreseeable future, although we will always continue to look at what's in the market, I think we really have a lot of what the market is looking for. And it's incumbent upon us to be able to actually capture and unlock that value. I would go so far as to say I suspect most of the organizations, from what I can see, that model Vale really haven't got visibility of the pipeline when you look at your own net asset value breakdowns and the opportunity set that this business has.
That's part of our job, is not only to deliver that and to show this quarter on quarter and beyond, but really to showcase that potential, which I think is invisible at this stage.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
I would just compliment and I would echo Shaun's view, especially given where we trade at currently. It is hard for us to do any transaction that makes sense for our shareholders. Now, the unique advantage of our portfolio is the endowment in base metals, as he's mentioned, is C1, but also in iron ore. So I think we can make a lot more money and generate a lot more value to our shareholders by developing our own endowment.
And sometimes there'll be an opportunity for us to share infrastructure and do deals that are creative for both partners, like the one we did recently at Minas-Rio. That is an example of deals that we like to do. It's capital-light, if you will, and those deals make sense. Large deals or things differently from that are harder for us to do, and I'd rather put our money to do our own development.

Our next question is from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. You can open your microphone.
Timna Tanners -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Happy Friday.
I wanted to start out asking about capex just because, as you point out in the bridge, there's quite a bit of a gap or a big amount that needs to be spent to meet your target in Q4. So is that happening, or should we think about a maybe lighter spend? And then, a bigger picture question I had was just the comment I heard earlier about how you had confidence that global steel margins were going to rebound. And I'm just curious what drives that. It'd be great to get your high-level thinking in light of the property sector challenges.
Thanks.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Timna. Happy Friday for you as well. We are looking to close the year within the guidance of around $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion. So it's looking very much in line with what we had guided throughout the year.
There's always some variances within quarters, but you should look at that full-year as the final number we're expecting to deliver in 2024. So I'll pass to Rogerio to talk about margins.
Rogerio Nogueira -- Interim Executive Vice President, Iron Ore Solutions
Hi, Timna. I think when you look into the iron ore market, we do believe that the market will stabilize, but we see potential upsides. On a more broadly basis, on a worldwide basis, we see CSP, crude steel production reaching 1.9 billion tons, with China being responsible for over 1 billion tons in 2024. And we do expect the same figures for 2025.
And as you know, I think this has been talked all over, the Chinese government is working to boost consumer confidence through fiscal and monetary stimulus, as we all have been hearing about. We believe that with that, steel consumption will stabilize and the decline in fixed asset investments in the property sector will be compensated, will be offset by fixed asset investments in the manufacturing and infrastructure sector. As a result, we expect a stable iron ore supply balance. We currently see inventory levels stable across the whole supply chain.
Despite the fact that we see high inventory levels at ports, we see very low inventory levels at the steel mills. So when we look at it on a more comprehensive basis, we believe that inventory levels are stable. Not only that, but when we look into the cost curve, we see that over 50 million tons of supply have support at $95 per ton in the cost curve, and close to 150 million tons have support at $90. So if prices come down, a lot of capacity, a lot of production, we will leave the market.
But more specifically to your question, in the short-term, we see some positive data. If you look into blast furnace utilization, the figures are increasing to 87%. Steel margins are recovering about a plus $20 per ton in rebar. It's about neutral in HRC.
And you see some regions, specifically the regions which are -- where they face less competition in China, where we have less steel mills already growing more significantly. Outside China, I think the market or the steel makers are struggling specifically with the Chinese exports. But if that actually exports reduce, demand will still be there, and we believe that they will be growing marginally.

Our next question comes from Christopher LaFemina with Jefferies. You can open your microphone.
Chris LaFemina -- Analyst
Hey. Thanks for taking my question. This is kind of a follow-up to what Timna just asked. If we look at the historic Vale strategy, including in the last quarter, you have at times taken higher cost, lower margin capacity offline.
I guess basically the value over volumes approach, which has probably been a pretty supportive factor in the market. And other companies have done this as well. And my question then is, how does the strategy change? I mean, if you're shifting your production mix to more higher quality, higher margin ore, does that imply that prices would have to fall further before you took capacity offline? I'm just kind of thinking, not necessarily where the market is going to be in 2024, 2025, or where it might be later in the decade with Simandou coming and with your own production mix shift, BHP has got some growth as well. And if we are in a scenario where the iron ore market is declining, if demand in China is weakening, and that kind of downside scenario, at what point do we start to see a supply response later in the decade? And again, with your cost going down and Simandou coming online, I'm just concerned that maybe it's not 90 to 100, but it could be considerably lower than that.
So that's kind of the question is where the downside would be later in the decade, if demand is indeed declining. Thank you.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
Let me maybe go over a few elements and then Rogerio, if you want to add. I think the one thing which I think fundamentally is important is even with Simandou, the amount of depletion that we are seeing in the market is enormous. And the degrading that we are also seeing in the market from our competitors is very relevant. And I think that sometimes it's overlooked.
So that's one element to take into consideration. That's why we are not as negative long term with the entrance of Simandou as one would probably be. In terms of the value of a volume strategy, I think they will continue. Certainly, they will continue or not, I think they will continue.
The good thing of us resuming capacity is that finally we start to have flexibility. Because post-Brumadinho, we've lost a lot of the flexibility that we had in our offerings. So now that we are bringing Vargem Grande, Capanema and we are back to 350, more than the volume per se, which is not what we chase, as Rogerio said. We will have the ability to then play within the market conditions to maximize value.
That flexibility we didn't have just a few years ago. And I think now finally we are having, which will give us the ability to remove volumes whenever they don't make sense. We've mentioned this last time, we could have gone beyond 330 million tons. We are removing from the market this year probably seven to eight million tons of high silica products that we could be putting in the market.
And we decided not to do because it's not the right thing to do from the market perspective. So we continue to be extremely disciplined on how we add volume to the market. The beauty of what we are doing here, I think, is the fact that we now have flexibility to play along depending on the different market conditions and we will continue to do so.

Our next question comes from Jon Brandt with HSBC. You can open your microphone.
Jonathan Brandt -- Analyst
Just one question for me, just as it relates to your overall metals portfolio. Obviously, if we look over the past 20 years, Vale has really transformed into sort of three main metals from many more. But recently we've seen some of your competitors maybe doing some M&A and adding to their product portfolio, either in lithium or fertilizers. So I'm just -- I'm wondering if we look out over the next five to 10 years, are you happy with your portfolio of iron ore, nickel and copper? Or would you look to add things like lithium fertilizers, potentially uranium? I guess that's my question.
Thank you.
Gustavo Pimenta -- Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Jon. Gustavo here. Look, we are happy with the portfolio we have. I would certainly like to have more copper than we have, but we'll be working on that.
So I think if we have anything in our portfolio, it has to have scale. We need to be well-positioned from any cost curve perspective. And what we have today are the commodities that we believe we can deliver that. At the end, it's about value creation.
So we like what we have. As a company, we are always assessing alternatives and opportunities, but we are happy with the commodities we have. And it's a question of how we can continue to grow them.

Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

BHP (NYSE:BHP) is up against a $47 billion lawsuit in the UK over the 2015 Mariana Dam disaster in Brazil. The case involves more than 600,000 claimants, including 46 local businesses and 2,000 governments, with the trial set to begin Monday in London's High Court. Additionally, up to 12 weeks are expected of hearing.
Arguing that it duplicates continuous legal procedures and compensation efforts in Brazil, BHP has challenged the lawsuit. The corporation believes that together with further settlement talks with the Brazilian government, around $8 billion in reparations paid through the Renova Foundation should be enough for the settlement. According to a Financial Times analysis, BHP and Brazilian mining company Vale (NYSE:VALE), its project partner, have jointly proposed a $23.8 billion settlement in Brazil. Operating under BHP and Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP, the Mariana Dam collapsed in 2015 causing 19 deaths, thousands of displacements, and major pollution of the Doce River.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with VALE.
According to BHP, its goal is to complete a fair and thorough pay system that would retain money within Brazil in assisting in the restoration of projects in impacted areas.

Brazillian mining company Vale (NYSE:VALE) has estimated the fines and compensation costs related to the 2015 Samarco dam collapse at $30 billion.
After years of negotiations between the Brazilian federal and state governments and Vale, BHP (NYSE:BHP), and Samarco Mineração joint venture, the resolution for one of the worst environmental disasters in Brazil's history is approaching.
The settlement under discussion would cover past and future obligations. Of the total $30 billion, $7.2 billion has already been invested in remediation and compensation efforts over the past years.
Another $19 billion will be paid over 20 years to fund compensatory programs aimed at the Brazilian government and the states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, where the disaster caused significant damage. An additional $6.1 billion will be allocated to performance obligations, such as environmental recovery, resettlement, and individual indemnifications for affected communities.
The Samarco disaster occurred in November 2015 when the Fundão tailings dam, holding mining waste, collapsed in Mariana, Minas Gerais. The collapse unleashed millions of cubic meters of toxic sludge, killing 19 people, destroying entire communities, and severely polluting 500 kilometers of the Doce River, which holds sacred importance to the Krenak indigenous tribe.
The disaster left thousands homeless and caused irreversible damage to local ecosystems and livelihoods. In the years since, Vale, BHP, and Samarco have faced multiple legal challenges to ensure full reparation for the damage caused.
Although companies initially clashed over the settlement costs, they reached a consensus in July, agreeing to share the financial responsibilities. Still, besides the Brazilian settlement, BHP faces a separate class action lawsuit in the United Kingdom.
The lawsuit began this week at the London High Court and involved over 620,000 claimants, including Brazilians, local governments, and businesses affected by the disaster.
The claimants seek up to 36 billion pounds ($47 billion) in damages, alleging that BHP bears liability for the dam collapse.
BHP contests the lawsuit, arguing that its compensation efforts in Brazil, including the $8 billion paid through the Renova Foundation, are sufficient.
The trial could last up to 12 weeks, and if successful, it would become one of the largest compensation awards in British legal history, setting a precedent for global environmental liability.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Oversold Large Cap Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stands against the other oversold large cap stocks.
The Fed recently reduced the funds rate by 50 basis points, a decision seen as daring by some analysts, though it has been largely embraced by the market and many experts. The market seems to be on an upward trajectory since the day of rate cuts as the S&P gained over 4.3% on October 14 and closed at another all-time high.
While there are some concerns, experts are quite optimistic that they won’t be of much significance as we discussed in our article about best-performing long-term stocks in 2024. Here is an excerpt from the article:
“Dominic Chu of CNBC expressed concerns about potential market overconfidence, given the calmness amid geopolitical risks, the upcoming U.S. presidential election, and consumer spending challenges. [Gunjan] Banerji acknowledged these risks but emphasized that much of the market’s optimism is tied to the Fed’s actions, with people reassured by the larger-than-expected rate cut.
Noah Blackstein, Senior Portfolio Manager at Dynamic Funds recently joined CNBC's ‘Squawk Box’ and showed optimism around the equity markets. He suggested that current highs may continue. He expects the Fed will implement two more rate cuts this year, which would help sustain market momentum. Despite some geopolitical uncertainties and election concerns, the broader expectation in the market since July, along with favorable banking and credit indicators, supports his positive outlook.
Blackstein believes the labor market's strength may be overstated and noted that revisions to employment data are likely due to a low participation rate in recent surveys. He also argued that real interest rates are historically high and tight, which further suggests the need for more cuts.
Regarding the economy, Blackstein expects further rate reductions to avoid potential market volatility, especially in light of recent hurricane impacts on employment and retail sales. He highlighted that while real interest rates may seem moderate when compared to the last 20 years, they are still elevated in historical terms.
As the Fed steers the economy away from a potential recession, Blackstein views the next phase as an opportunity for long-term growth, especially in areas like family housing and AI. He believes AI will drive a productivity revolution and integrate data strategies into several sectors, which will ultimately lead to cost savings and revenue growth for corporations.
Our Methodology
To list 10 oversold large-cap stocks, we used a Finviz screener to extract stocks that have fallen significantly on a YTD basis and have a forward P/E ratio between 5x to 15x. After getting a list of 20 stocks, we narrowed it to the most widely held by institutional investors. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) is a Brazilian multinational corporation and is the world’s largest producer of iron ore and nickel, with operations across 30 countries. The company also produces manganese, copper, bauxite, and other minerals, while also managing extensive logistics operations such as railroads, ports, and ships. The company also invests in renewable energy through hydroelectric plants.
Vale (NYSE:VALE) recently announced that it has achieved record iron ore output and increased its production forecasts for 2024. The company surpassed its previous record of Q4 2018 as iron ore production increased by 5% year-over-year to 91 million tons due to improved performance at key sites like S11D, Itabira, and Brucutu.
The company also ramped up pellet production by 13%, reaching 10.4 million tons. Sales of iron ore rose by 2%, totaling 81.8 million tons. Copper production grew by 5% to 85.9 thousand tons, driven by improved performance across all operations, despite a disruption at Salobo 3 in June. Ore processed at Salobo 1 and 2 was up 30% year-over-year due to strong mill performance.
Nickel production increased by 12%, reaching 47.1 thousand tons, largely due to better results from Sudbury and progress at the Voisey’s Bay underground mines.
Vale’s (NYSE:VALE) is also quite focused on technologies that drive sustainability in mining and metals. In September, Its venture capital initiative, Vale Ventures invested in Mantel, a Boston-based startup focused on developing a low-cost carbon capture technology using molten borates.
The technology aims to help decarbonize heavy industries, including mining and steel production. The investment, part of Mantel’s $30 million Series A round supports the creation of a demonstration plant capable of capturing 1,800 tons of CO2 annually.
Overall VALE ranks 5th on our list of the oversold large cap stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of VALE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VALE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Vale,2024-10-18,Vale to Report Q3 Earnings: Here's What You Should Know,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=48a74566b417a8d7f99a455a639f7f35d7e88dc800c05229384b28d9837579dd,"VALE's Q3 performance is likely to have benefited from increased copper revenues, offset by lower nickel and iron ore revenues as well as higher costs.","Oops, something went wrong
Vale S.A. VALE is expected to report declines in its bottom and top lines when it reports third-quarter 2024 results on Oct. 25, after market close.
Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vale’s sales is pegged at $10.09 billion, indicating a 5% decrease from the year-ago quarter's figure. The consensus mark for earnings has moved down 9.3% over the past 60 days to 49 cents per share. The figure indicates a 25.8% year-over-year decline.

VALE's earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and beat the mark in the other two, delivering an average negative surprise of 7.98%.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Vale recently provided its third-quarter production and sales update, which may show how it is likely to fare in the to-be-reported quarter. Iron ore production was around 91 Mt, up 5.5% year over year, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2018. This can be attributed to improved operating performance at S11D, Itabira and Brucutu.  Pellet production rose 13% year over year to 10.4 Mt. Iron production came slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90.4 Mt.
Iron ore fines sales dipped 0.5% from the year-ago quarter's level to 69.3 Mt while pellet sales rose 17.8% to 10.1 Mt. However, the average realized iron ore fines price was $90.60 per ton, down 13.8% year over year due to lower iron ore prices. Realized prices for iron ore pellets declined 8% to $148.2 per ton.
The Iron Solutions segment accounts for around 93% of Vale’s revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for iron ore revenues is pegged at $6.4 billion, indicating a 13% decline year over year. Gains from improved pellet sales volumes are likely to have been somewhat offset by reduced iron ore fines sales as well as lower iron prices. The consensus mark for pellets revenues is pinned at $1.18 billion, indicating a 15% decline from the year-ago quarter's level.
Nickel sales were recorded at 40.7 kt, up 3.8% from the year-ago  quarter’s figure. The figure was lower than the consensus estimate of 45 kt.The average realized nickel price was $17,012 per ton, down 20% from the year-ago quarter's figure. This reflected a decrease in LME nickel reference prices, partially offset by higher realized premiums. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for nickel revenues is pegged at $870.7 million, indicating a 15% decline year over year owing to lower prices.
Vale sold 75.2 kt of copper in the third quarter, which was 1.9% higher than the prior-year quarter's figure. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92.6 kt.
The average realized price for copper operations only (Salobo and Sossego) was $9,016 per ton, up 16.6% year over year. The average realized copper price for all operations (including copper sales originating from nickel operations) was $9,053 per ton.
The consensus estimate for copper revenues is pegged at $974 million, indicating a 48% surge from the year-ago quarter's figure. This reflects higher sales and improved year-over-year prices.
Overall, Vale’s revenues are likely to have gained from higher sales volumes for copper, nickel and pellet as well as elevated copper prices compared with the year-ago quarter. This is expected to have been offset by lower iron ore fines sales volume as well as reduced prices for iron ore and nickel.
The company has been facing higher input costs, particularly diesel and freight costs, in the past few quarters. This is likely to have weighed on its margins. However, cost-control efforts are expected to have negated some of this impact.
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Vale this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat but that is not the case here.
Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Vale is -18.84%. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Zacks Rank: Vale currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
In a year, shares of Vale have lost 16.7%, in line with the industry.

BHP Group BHP announced that its iron ore production rose 2% year over year to 64.6 Mt in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2024). This was attributed to an increase in production at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) following the commissioning of the Port Debottlenecking Project and completion of the South Flank ramp-up.
Iron ore production at Samarco increased 4% in the quarter due to the early resumption of Pelletizing Plant No. 4. BHP’s iron ore production guidance for fiscal 2025 remains unchanged at 255-265.5 Mt. WAIO's production is expected to be between 250 Mt and 260 Mt (282 Mt and 294 Mt on a 100% basis).

Copper production at Escondida increased 11% year over year as mining progressed into areas of higher-grade ore as well as increased concentrator feed grade. This was partially offset by planned lower cathode production.
Copper output at Pampa Norte slumped 23%. Production at Spence was down 13% due to lower cathode production as a result of planned quarterly maintenance at the concentrator and a decline in stacked feed grade.
Production was down on a year-over-year basis reflecting the impact of Cerro Colorado entering temporary care and maintenance in December 2023. It had contributed 9.5 kt of copper output in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.
Production from Copper South Australia was reported at 73 kt, 2% higher than the prior fiscal quarter aided by upbeat underlying operational performance. Production was lower at Prominent Hill due to minor pit geotechnical instability and ventilation constraints, which impacted trucking capacity and production. BHP assured that these issues have been rectified.
Antamina’s copper production rose 12% to 36 kt on higher ore grade and recoveries, partially offset by planned lower concentrator throughput.
The company expects copper production within the range of 1,845-2,045 kt in fiscal 2024.
Nickel production was down 3% year over year to 19.6 kt in the fiscal first quarter. This reflected BHP’s decision to temporarily suspend the Nickel West operation starting in October 2024, citing lower nickel prices.
Starting January 2025, BHP plans to invest around $300 million annually to keep the operation in readiness for a potential restart in case the market rebounds.
Energy coal production rose 2% year over year to 3.7 Mt in the quarter. Steelmaking coal production was 4.5 Mt, which declined 19% from the year-ago quarter. Production in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 included 1.8 Mt (3.7 Mt on a 100% basis) from the Blackwater and Daunia mines that were divested on April 2, 2024. Excluding these volumes, production of steelmaking coal was up 20% year over year.
Production guidance for steelmaking coal is in the band of 16.5-19 Mt while energy coal guidance in the range of 13 Mt to 15 Mt in fiscal 2025.
In the fiscal first quarter, average realized prices for iron ore were down 18% year over year to $80.10 per ton. Copper prices were up 17% to $4.24 per pound. Average nickel prices were $16,359 per ton, down 20% from the year-ago quarter. Prices for thermal coal dipped 1% year over year to $124.32 per ton and steelmaking coal prices were down 9% to $214.86 per ton.
In July 2024, BHP and Lundin Mining Corporation LUNMF agreed to jointly acquire Filo Corp, which owns 100% of the Filo del Sol (FDS) copper project. BHP and Lundin Mining have also agreed to form a 50/50 joint venture to advance the FDS and Josemaria projects.
BHP commenced construction of Jansen Stage 2 for potash in fiscal 2024. It had been 4% completed in the fiscal first quarter.  Meanwhile, the Jansen Stage 1 has been 58% completed. The operating expenditure related to potash is expected to be around $300 million in the current fiscal 2025.
Vale S.A. VALE reported iron ore production of around 91 Mt for the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a 5.5% increase from the year-ago quarter. This marks VALE’s highest output since the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by improved operating performances at Itabira and Brucutu. The company’s iron ore production guidance for 2024 is in the range of 323-330 Mt.
Vale produced 85.9 kt of copper, which was 5.3% higher than the year-ago quarter. The company expects to produce copper in the range of 320 - 355 kt.
Rio Tinto RIO reported a 1% year-over-year improvement in its third-quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2024) iron ore production to 84.1 Mt (on a 100% basis) as productivity gains offset ore depletion. This brings RIO’s total iron ore output for the nine-month period to 242.9 Mt, a decline of 1% year over year.
Iron-ore shipments for the quarter (on a 100% basis) were reported at 84.5 Mt, up 1% year over year. Rio Tinto expects Pilbara iron ore shipments (100% basis) to be between 323 Mt and 338 Mt in 2024. The midpoint of the guidance indicates a year-over-year dip of 0.4%. 
Copper production was 168 thousand tons in the third quarter, 1% lower than the year-ago quarter. RIO expects copper production to be between 660 thousand tons and 720 thousand tons in 2024, indicating 11.3% growth at the midpoint.

Vale S.A. VALE reported iron ore production of around 91 million tons (Mt) for the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a 5.5% increase from the year-ago quarter. This marks VALE’s highest output since the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by improved operating performances at Itabira and Brucutu.
During the quarter, the S11D mine produced 22.1 Mt of iron ore, a 14% year-over-year increase. This was the seventh quarter of a year-over-year production improvement delivered by the mine, bolstered by ongoing asset reliability initiatives.
Vale’s pellet production rose 13% year over year to 10.4 Mt. This was the highest quarterly production since 2018, driven by higher pellet feed availability from the Brucutu and Itabira mines, and increasing pellet production at the Tubarão site.
Iron ore fines sales dipped 0.5% from the year-ago quarter to 69.3 Mt while pellet sales were up 17.8% to around 10.1 Mt. Total iron ore sales were up 1.6% to 81.8 Mt on the back of higher pellet sales.
Vale reported an inventory of 5.5 Mt at the end of the quarter, mainly due to cargos in transit along the supply chain as production seasonally increased in the third quarter. These inventories will be converted into sales in the ongoing quarter. 
The average realized iron ore fines price was $90.60 per ton in the September-ended quarter, down 13.8% year over year and 7.7% sequentially due to lower iron ore prices.
Vale's iron ore production totaled 242.2 Mt in the first nine-month period of 2024. The figure is 4.6% higher than the production in the comparable period in the previous year.
The company, on Sept. 9, had increased its 2024 iron ore production guidance to the range of 323-330 Mt from its previous guidance of 310-320 Mt. The revision was backed by continued improvements in operational stability and asset reliability. The updated guidance indicates 1.7% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. 
To meet its iron ore production target for the year, Vale needs to produce iron ore in the range of 80.8-90.8 Mt in the fourth quarter. The company had produced 89.4 Mt of iron ore in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Pellet production is projected to be between 38 Mt and 42 Mt , higher than the figure of 36.5 Mt in 2023.
In the third quarter, Vale produced 85.9 kt of copper, which was 5.3% higher than the year-ago quarter. Salobo 1&2 plants reported a 30% year-over-year improvement in ore processed. This was offset by the impact of the conveyor belt fire that occurred at the Salobo 3 plant as well as lower feed grades. Copper output at Sossego was up aided by higher mined volumes and  feed grade to the mill.
Vale sold 75.2 kt of copper, which was up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter. Sales volumes were, however, lower than production due to in-transit volumes and Vale Base Metals’ commercial strategy.
The average realized price for copper operations only (Salobo and Sossego) was $9,016 per ton, up 16.6% year over year but down 2% on a sequential basis. The average realized copper price for all operations (including copper sales originating from nickel operations) was $9,053 per ton.
Production of nickel increased 3.8% year over year to 47.1 kt in the July-September 2024 period. This reflects improved performance in Sudbury and the continued ramp-up of Voisey’s Bay underground mines.
Nickel sales were recorded at 40.7 kt, up 3.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Sales were lower than production due to an inventory build-up and Vale Base Metals’ sales strategy.
The average realized nickel price was $17,012 per ton, down 20% from the year-ago quarter. This was in line with the decrease in LME nickel reference prices, partially offset by higher realized premiums.
Vale expects to produce copper in the range of 320-355 kt. The company’s copper output in 2023 was reported at 326.6 kt.
The company expects nickel output to be between 153 kt and 168 kt. In 2023, it had produced 164.9 kt of nickel.
Vale recently reported a temporary suspension of operations at its Onça Puma nickel plant due to an outage at the local electricity company's transmission network. It estimates this disruption to impact its nickel production by 1.5- 2.0 kt in the fourth quarter of 2024. Despite this setback, Vale maintained its nickel production guidance at 153-168 kt . Yesterday, it announced the resumption of power supply to the plant and the start of the operation ramp-up .
Rio Tinto RIO reported a 1% year-over-year improvement in its third-quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2024) iron ore production to 84.1 Mt (on a 100% basis) as productivity gains offset ore depletion. This brings RIO’s total iron ore output for the nine-month period to 242.9 Mt, a decline of 1% year over year.
Iron-ore shipments for the quarter (on a 100% basis) were reported at 84.5 Mt, up 1% year over year. Rio Tinto expects Pilbara iron ore shipments (100% basis) to be between 323 Mt and 338 Mt in 2024. The midpoint of the guidance indicates a year-over-year dip of 0.4%. 
Copper production was 168 thousand tons in the third quarter , 1% lower than the year-ago quarter. RIO expects copper production to be between 660 thousand tons and 720 thousand tons in 2024, indicating 11.3% growth at the midpoint.
BHP Group BHP announced its iron ore production rose 2% year over year to 64.6 Mt in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2024). Production at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) was up 2% to 63.4 Mt, aided by strong supply-chain performance with increased capacity unlocked by the Port Debottlenecking Project 1.
Iron ore production guidance is at 255 – 265.5 Mt for fiscal 2025. BHP’s iron ore production for fiscal 2024 was a record 260 Mt.
Copper output improved 4% year over year to 476.3 kt in the fiscal first quarter . BHP maintained its copper production guidance for fiscal 2025 at between 1,845 kt and 2,045 kt. The company had produced 1,865 kt of copper in fiscal 2024, the highest in 15 years.

Vale,2024-10-17,Investors Heavily Search VALE S.A. (VALE): Here is What You Need to Know,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=bd78d851396ff6ee2f9b451adfe8063016ffa6684cdbd402b9dedb0b4f61b892,"VALE (VALE) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","Oops, something went wrong
VALE S.A. (VALE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +4.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Iron industry, which VALE falls in, has gained 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, VALE is expected to post earnings of $0.55 per share, indicating a change of -16.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.3% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.04 points to a change of +11.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -3.3%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.09 indicates a change of +2.4% from what VALE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.3%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for VALE.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For VALE, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.09 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $39.34 billion and $41.87 billion estimates indicate -5.9% and +6.4% changes, respectively.
VALE reported revenues of $9.92 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.6%. EPS of $0.43 for the same period compares with $0.20 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.46%. The EPS surprise was +13.16%.
Over the last four quarters, VALE surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
VALE is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about VALE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.89%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 3, 2025. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.

Market participants will be closely following the financial results of VALE S.A. in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on October 25, 2024.

Vale,2024-10-09,VALE S.A. (VALE) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: Here's Why,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=32366767637e5af336787d0ebfdd15315a55c8f72ca174008bdf76ac8e40f84a,"VALE S.A. (VALE) concluded the recent trading session at $10.91, signifying a -1.27% move from its prior day's close.","Oops, something went wrong
VALE S.A. (VALE) ended the recent trading session at $10.91, demonstrating a -1.27% swing from the preceding day's closing price. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.71%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.03%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.6%.
Coming into today, shares of the company had gained 11.5% in the past month. In that same time, the Basic Materials sector gained 5.75%, while the S&P 500 gained 6.41%.
The upcoming earnings release of VALE S.A. will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $0.59, reflecting a 10.61% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $10.45 billion, down 1.58% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.14 per share and revenue of $39.7 billion. These totals would mark changes of +16.94% and -4.98%, respectively, from last year.
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for VALE S.A. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.
Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.33% higher. Right now, VALE S.A. possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
With respect to valuation, VALE S.A. is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 5.18. This indicates no noticeable deviation in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 5.18.
Also, we should mention that VALE has a PEG ratio of 0.3. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Mining - Iron industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.3 as trading concluded yesterday.
The Mining - Iron industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 105, which puts it in the top 42% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.
Be sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.

We recently compiled a list of the 7 dirt cheap stocks to invest in now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stands against the other the Dirt cheap stocks to invest in now.
The stock market is at a turning point after one of the longest bull runs in recent history. With major market indices close to all-time highs, valuations are getting out of hand. Likewise, the earnings season has seen increased volatility, though, with some significant selling of semiconductor and artificial intelligence stocks that used to draw investors.
Soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are complicating the situation and triggering risk aversions in the market. Investors are becoming increasingly cautious and resorting to safe-haven assets due to concerns about a full-blown war in the Middle East that could seriously impact the global economy.

Growing geopolitical tensions have been a factor in the stock market’s erratic start to October. According to Barbara Doran, founder of BD8 Capital Partners, things getting out of hand in the Middle East could cause stocks to decline.
Surveys of public opinion already indicate that jitters are rising in the market. A gauge of consumer confidence saw its most significant one-month drop in over three years last week. Furthermore, the National Federation of Independent Business reports that a recent survey of confidence among small-business owners dropped more than anticipated in early September, maintaining the gauge below its 50-year average for 32 straight months.
“We’re in a Goldilocks moment for the U.S. economy,” said Rich Nuzum, chief investment strategist at Mercer. “But Goldilocks moments are rare, and they tend not to last long. So when does something go bump in the night?”
While the market is priced at a premium due to the artificial intelligence frenzy, it does not mean there are no bargains. There are dozens of dirt cheap stocks to invest in now that are trading at discounted valuations depicted by low price-to-earnings multiple and solid underlying fundamentals.
Interest rate reduction was expected to benefit small-cap stocks. That isn’t happening. The Federal Reserve’s dramatic interest rate cut two weeks ago has caused the small-cap-focused Russell 2000 index to fall by 0.5%, lagging behind the S&P 500’s 1.3% gain.
According to Bank of America, investors should be aware of a few important US stocks while navigating the current market climate. In a note to clients, strategist Nigel Tupper stated that a combination of improving global earnings cycle, easier monetary policy in the US as inflation returns to the target level, and China’s recent multifaceted stimulus appears supportive of equity markets and cyclicals.
It is important to note that not all investments will yield significant returns, considering valuations have gotten out of hand with the S&P 500 at an all-time high. Nevertheless, long-term investors can make substantial gains by selecting solid growth stocks trading at discounted valuations. An undervalued company backed by excellent financial fundamentals, such as robust revenue and earnings growth, will always elicit strong interest from professional investors. Therefore, it is likely to enjoy significant share price appreciations down the line.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicts that declining interest rates and rising real wages will contribute to a modest increase in global economic growth this year and next year, which is one of the reasons to be bullish about dirt-cheap stocks.
Our Methodology
To compile the list of dirt cheap stocks to invest in now, we sifted through screeners and reports, scanning for high-quality stocks trading at discounted valuations. From an initial list of 20 stocks, we settled on the top seven stocks that were trading under a forward P/E of 10, as of October 7, and were the most widely held by hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that hold them, as of Q2 2024.
At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 5.60
Number of Hedge Fund holders as of Q2: 45
Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) is a heavy mining company and one of the largest iron ore pellets and nickel producers. While headquartered in Brazil, it operates in more than 20 countries. It is the world’s leading iron and nickel producer, and other metals like manganese and copper are used in battery production.
Consequently, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) is one of the companies well-positioned to benefit from the electric vehicle revolution, fuelling strong demand for nickel used in batteries and iron. The company benefits from the scale of its operations by the impressive results it always generates as demand for basic materials increases.
The company delivered better-than-expected second-quarter results, with net profit soaring to record highs of $2.77 billion, nearly triple what it generated last year in the same quarter. The fact that Q2 net profit was 65% higher than in the first quarter underscores the underlying growth as the company benefits from high commodity prices. Revenues were up 3% to $9.9 billion as iron shipments soared 7%
Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) remains in a solid financial position, consistently generating a healthy amount of free cash flow from its operations. With dividend yields expected to surpass 7% in 2024 and 2025 from the current 5, there is no doubt that Vale is one of the dirt cheap stocks to invest in now for passive income—additionally, the stock trades at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 5.60.
Hedge funds with investments in Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) were 34 in the quarter, with positions worth $1.15 billion. GQG Partners is the top shareholder in the company as of Q2 of 2024, with a position worth $334.61 million.
Overall VALE ranks 5th on our list of 7 dirt cheap stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of VALE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VALE, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.89%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 3, 2025. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Vale,2024-10-07,Vale Anticipates Interruption at Onca Puma to Affect Q4 Nickel Output,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=07d29873035951a8e8b61e38d66be0c6c0ec9f1c6b6668aec40b864b1b02177a,"VALE temporarily suspends operations at its Onca Puma nickel plant, which will likely lower its nickel output by 1.5-2.0 kt in the fourth quarter.","Oops, something went wrong
Vale S.A. VALE reported a temporary suspension of operations at its Onça Puma nickel plant due to an outage at the local electricity company's transmission network. It estimates this disruption to impact its nickel production by 1.5- 2.0 kt in the fourth quarter of 2024. Despite this setback, Vale maintained its previously stated guidance of nickel production at 153-168 kt for 2024.
The interruption was caused by damage to the local electricity company's transmission network after strong winds on Oct. 5. The electricity transmission network is expected to be restored by Oct. 15. The company will meanwhile continue to assess the impacts of the interruption on nickel production at Onça Puma. Vale will implement the necessary measures to resume the affected operational processes. It confirmed that there have been no incidents regarding the safety of employees, neighboring communities or its assets at the site.
In the first half of 2024, Onca Puma’s nickel production was 3 kt, 71.7% lower than 10.6 kt in the first half of 2023. The output at Onca Puma was impacted by the furnace rebuild works that began in the fourth quarter of 2023. After the conclusion of the rebuilding process, metal production at the mine resumed in mid-May. The mine’s production in the first quarter of 2024 was nil and was 3 kt in the second quarter, which was down 47.4% year over year.
Vale’s total production of nickel was down 14% year over year to 67.3 kt in the January-June 2024 period. This reflects the impact of the planned maintenance strategy at the nickel processing plants.
The mine has also faced other headwinds this year. In February 2024, the Pará State Environment Secretariat (SEMAS) suspended the Onca Puma mine's operating license, alleging non-compliance with environmental requirements. Following this decision, Vale filed for an injunction and, on Feb. 26, 2024, Ourilândia’s lower court reinstated the mine’s operating license.
However, on March 1, the State filed an appeal with the Pará State Court, which defered the above decision and the mine’s operating license was suspended. On June 27, Vale informed that it had reached agreements with the Pará State General Attorney's office and SEMAS. The operating licenses for Onça Puma were reinstated.
Vale, on Sept. 11, lowered its nickel output expectations. It expects nickel output for 2024 to be between 153 kt and 168 kt, down from the earlier stated range of 160-175 kt. In 2023, it had produced 164.9 kt of nickel. The revised guidance indicates a year-over-year decline of up to 7.2% to growth of up to 1.9%. Vale cited the partial divestment from Vale Indonesia, completed in July, as the reason for the revision in expectations.
For 2026, Vale expects its nickel production to be between 230 kt and 245 kt, reflecting replenishment projects in Canada, exposure to Pomalaa and Morowali, and the start-up of the second furnace at Onça Puma. As of 2030, nickel production shall be more than 300 kt, with input from projects such as Thompson Ultramafics, Sorowako HPAL, partnership projects and offtake.
Vale’s shares have plunged 10.9% in a year, in line with the industry.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.89%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 3, 2025. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Bargain Stocks To Buy in October. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (VALE) stands against the other bargain stocks.
September has historically been sluggish for stocks. However, with an easing cycle and an upcoming election in store, the results this year may be untypical. On September 26, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the market outlook ahead of the easing cycle.
Lee suggests that an easing cycle indefinitely improves the performance of markets, especially from a historical standpoint, hinting that with 40 days to the election, the market may change its course of action accordingly. While stocks reposition themselves positively after an easing cycle, the markets may see delays, especially because investors are more likely to wait until after the results are out.
Lee added that rallies in November and December will be significantly high, especially when markets have been up more than 10% in the first half of the fiscal year 2024. While the economy is not officially in a recession, the number of investors and analysts who believe the economy is going down is immense. Therefore, to get investors on the move evidence has to be better than expected.
The 50 basis point cut may have redeemed positive results for the market. On September 28, Matt Powers, Powers Advisory Group managing partner, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the plausible sectors to target as elections approach.
Powers shared that inflation numbers validated the 50 basis point cut, showing positive economic signs. However, he does reiterate that there will be some short-term volatility, especially in October.
According to him, investors must focus more on stocks in the defensive sectors, including utilities, consumer staples, and financials. Powers advises investors to spare some short-term equity but focus on long-term and medium-term results. Overall, he believes that the market is more balanced and a reallocation to the dividend stocks and dividend ETFs is highly probable.
Now that we have studied the aftermath of the easing cycle and the market outlook before an impending election, let's take a look at the 8 best bargain stocks to buy in October according to analysts.
Our Methodology 
To come up with the best bargain stocks in October, we used the Finviz screener to find stocks trading at a forward P/E of less than 20. We sorted our screen by market cap and went through the 30 biggest stocks. We then shortlisted the stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds, as of Q2 2024, and that analysts saw the most upside to. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of analysts' upside potential.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Forward P/E as of September 28, 2024: 5.51
Analyst Upside Potential as of September 28, 2024: 27%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34
Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) is one of the best bargain stocks in October according to analysts. The mining company is headquartered in Brazil and is present in more than 20 countries. The company engages in sustainable mining and is one of the largest producers of iron ore, pellets, and nickel. It also has operations in the logistics of mineral exporting.
The company’s responsibility towards the planet is remarkable. Currently, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)  produces 54% of the energy it consumes and protects 8,500 square feet of natural areas, 6 times the size of its operations. Over the years the company has launched a range of initiatives to give back to society including the Vale Foundation, Valia Portal, Vale Museum, Vale Cultural Institute, Vale Fund, and Vale Social Network, to name a few.
On the financial front, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) logged $9.92 billion in revenue during the second quarter. In addition to that, the company reported record performances in production. Iron ore production stood at 81 metric tons (MT), S11D production at 20 MT, and iron sales at 90 MT, up by 3%, 2%, and 7% year-over-year, respectively.
Overall, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) is set to add another 50 metric tons of capacity by 2026, making it one of the best bargain stocks to buy now. The company also signed a partnership for a new iron ore concentration plant in Sohar, which will be completed by 2027.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.89%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 3, 2025. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Worst Performing Affordable Stocks Under $40. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stands against the other worst performing affordable stocks under $40.
The stock market has been anxiously waiting for the interest rate cut news. Analysts had been debating whether the Federal Reserve would make a 25-point or 50-point cut. The wait was finally over with good news for the market.
On September 18, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee decided to cut the borrowing rates by the higher end of the expectation, which was 50 basis points. The rate cut indicated that inflation is moderating and that the labor market has weakened. This marked the first rate cut since the COVID-19 pandemic.
The decision was not unanimous as Fed Governor Michelle Bowman wanted a quarter-point cut. Moreover, the chairman Jerome Powell called the cuts to be a “recalibration”. One thing that the committee was confident about is the fact that inflation is moving sustainably towards the 2% mark.
Right after the decision the Dow Jones index jumped 375 points and then eased a little as the market digested the news. In one of our recent articles about 10 Worst Affordable Stocks To Buy Right Now, we talked about how Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder was confident that the market will perform positively both moving in and out of the announcement. Here’s an excerpt from the article:
""Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, joined CNBC to talk about how the market is expected to perform moving into the fed rate cuts and after the announcement. Lee believes that one of the factors leading to confusion among investors is the election period. The market is expected to stay in a fluctuating environment for the next eight weeks until the elections are over. However, fed rate cuts are coming at a crucial time to give some positive for the market.
Jeremy Siegel, professor emeritus of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business and Wisdom Tree chief economist, recently appeared on CNBC and expressed that he was pleasantly surprised by the Federal Reserve’s decision to make a 50 basis point cut. While talking about how the market is going to perform after the announcement, Professor Siegel said the market is going to be at an all-time high and there are not going to be any fluctuations as we have seen in the past few days.
The word “recalibration” holds significance here, the market has been 100% towards the target unemployment around 80% to 90% towards the inflation target and the Fed hadn’t moved the interest rate. Professor Siegel pointed out that the gap has been growing between the Fed Funds and the market conditions and they were thinking about a single cut by year-end until June. However, the latest announcement mentioned the Fed will cut rates at each meeting making a total of 6 cuts until June of next year. This will bring the Fed Funds rate down 200 basis points to 3.3%, which is where the professor thinks it should be.
Overall, the market and the economy seem to be heading towards a period of growth. The only foreseeable headwind is if the inflation picks up, however, analysts don’t see any signs of inflation picking up; rather they see all major industries doing well especially now that the rates have been cut.
Our Methodology
To compile the list of the 10 worst performing affordable stocks under $40, we used the Finviz stock screener. We first defined criteria to ensure we only got the worst performing affordable stocks. We selected stocks trading below the market average Forward P/E (i.e. 23.79 as per Wall Street Journal), with earnings expected to grow this year, average analyst median price target upside potential of at least 30%, and a year-to-date decline of at least 30%. Moreover, we also ensured that these stocks were trading below $40 and were widely held by institutional investors.
Once the criteria were defined, we then selected 10 stocks that fit our criteria and ranked them in ascending order of the Year-to-Date decline. Please note that all the indicators used to rank the list were recorded on September 18.
Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Share Price: $10.58
Analyst Upside Potential: 41.78%

Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) is one of the major mining companies based in Brazil. The company mainly focuses on iron ore and nickel production. With operations running in more than 30 countries, the company plays a key role in the construction and manufacturing industry by providing iron ore in large quantities.
In fact, during the most recent quarter which is Q2 2024, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) achieved record high production since 2018. The company produced 81 megatons of iron with its S11D reaching a record production for the quarter. As a result of high production, the shipment also increased by 7% year-over-year leading to a reaffirmed 2024 guidance of $21.5 to $23 per ton.
Despite robust performance, the company missed analysts' expectations in terms of revenue and EPS. During the second quarter, it generated $9.9 billion in revenue, $98.3 million short of market consensus. Moreover, the stock has declined 32.65% on a year-to-date basis and is among one of the worst performing affordable stocks under $40.
But the story does not end here. We have already seen how the company recently reached a record-high production of iron, and management’s strategic goal to become a preferred low-carbon steel supplier is still to be discussed. Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) has two major projects under construction. These projects will add more than 30 megatons of iron to the company’s portfolio, combined. The Vargem  Grande and Capanema projects are nearing construction and will be ready to operate soon, meaning a step forward toward management’s goal.
Analysts have also acknowledged the progress. 24 analysts have a consensus Buy rating on the stock, with their median price target of $15 presenting an upside of 42% from current levels.
Miller Value Partners Income Strategy made the following comment about Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:
“Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) fell during the quarter with iron ore prices. The company reported 1Q23 revenue of $8.44B, -22.7% Y/Y, below consensus of $8.79B, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.69B, compared to 1Q22 EBITDA of $6.55B, below consensus of $4.49B. The Brazilian miner produced 66.8 million tons (Mt) of iron ore in 1Q23, +5.8% Y/Y, below consensus of 67.7 Mt, 67.0 thousand tons (kt) of copper, +18.4% Y/Y, and 41.0 kt of nickel, -10.5% Y/Y. Although management reaffirmed its FY23 production guidance, analysts seemed to be concerned by the negatively offsetting impacts of weaker iron ore prices as China, the world’s largest iron ore buyer, has threatened to curb any “unreasonable” price gains for the metal in an effort to prevent this year’s steel output from exceeding 2022 levels. Vale generated 1Q23 free cash flow (FCF) of $2.28B, bringing trailing-twelve month (TTM) FCF to $6.73B, or a FCF yield of 11.3%. The company repurchased $763MM worth of shares in the quarter and paid $1.80B in dividends, bringing total capital returned to shareholders in the quarter to $2.56B, or 4.3% of the company’s market cap.”
Overall VALE ranks 7th on our list of the worst performing affordable stocks under $40. While we acknowledge the potential of VALE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a promising AI stock that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Vale S.A. VALE raised its 2024 production guidance for iron ore. The company also reported progress in negotiations related to the Samarco dam disaster with a settlement expected in October. The iron ore miner has started wet processing operations at the Vargem Grande 1 Project. These developments have contributed to a 6% increase in Vale’s share price.
The iron ore miner expects iron ore production of 323-330 Mt for 2024. The updated guidance indicates growth of 1-3% from the 321 Mt of iron ore produced in 2023. 
This is a revision from Vale’s previous guidance of 310-320 Mt, which indicated a decline of 0.3-3.4%.
Vale expects nickel output in 2024 between 153 kt and 168 kt, down from the earlier stated 160-175 kt. In 2023, it had produced 164.9 kt of nickel. The revised guidance indicates a year-over-year decline of up to 7.2% to growth of up to 1.9%.
Vale cited the partial divestment from Vale Indonesia, completed in July, as the reason for the revision in expectations.
Vale has started the commissioning of wet processing operations in the Vargem Grande 1 Project in Minas Gerais, one month ahead of schedule. This will aid iron ore production at the Vargem Grande complex to resume the level of 15 million metric tons per year.
The Vargem Grande 1 plant has been operating with natural moisture since 2019 due to the unavailability of water capture and disposal at the Vargem Grande dam. The dam is currently undergoing de-characterization, a process that eliminates the dam's function of retaining tailings and water to increase the safety of nearby communities.
With the shift to wet processing, Vale expects to improve the project’s average ore quality by approximately 2% in iron content. The project is expected to aid it in achieving iron ore production guidance of 340-360 million metric tons by 2026.
Following a routine inspection that identified superficial cracks in the Forquilha III dam at the Fábrica mine in Ouro Preto, Vale is conducting further verifications.
Although the Forquilha III dam is at emergency level 3, the company stated that the structure’s stability conditions remain unchanged. Safety measures, including downstream containment and evacuation zones, are in place.
On Nov. 5, 2015, the Fundão tailings dam at the Samarco Mariana Mining Complex collapsed and caused environmental and community impacts, claiming 19 lives. The dam was owned and operated by Samarco, a joint venture between BHP Group’s BHP subsidiary and Vale.
Vale, alongside Samarco and BHP, has been in negotiations with Brazilian authorities to seek a settlement for the obligations and other claims related to the dam failure. Last week, it confirmed that the negotiations have advanced and the company, along with BHP and Samarco, expects to reach a final settlement in the mediation process in October 2024.
Vale’s shares plunged 25.3% in a year, in line with the industry.

The decline in Vale’s share price reflects the downward trend in iron ore prices this year as China’s prolonged property crisis has impacted demand for iron ore. Prices are currently at around $92 per ton, dragged down by disappointing economic data from China.
Vale currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Some better-ranked stocks from the basic materials space are Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS and IAMGOLD Corporation IAG. CRS and IAG sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Carpenter Technology’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.06 per share. The consensus estimate for earnings has moved 17% north in the past 60 days. It has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 15.9%. CRS’ shares have gained 106.1% in a year.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IAMGOLD’s 2024 earnings is pegged at 39 cents per share. The consensus estimate for earnings has moved 44% north in the past 60 days. It has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 200%. IAG’s shares have gained 135.7% in a year.

We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Commodity Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stands against the other commodity stocks.
Two major trends that are shaping commodity markets are the rising interconnection of the market and the increasing importance of power in the energy transition, as per a report. The link between necessary commodities for the energy transition, such as LNG and metals, grew to 56% in 2022-23, up from 27% in 2015-19. With the introduction of more than 100 new tankers in the previous three years, the supply of LNG is rising dramatically. By 2028, it is anticipated that there will be more LNG carriers than oil carriers. Flexible contracts and increased competition between Europe and Asia are the main causes of this change.
Moreover, estimates suggest that power will play a larger part in the energy transition by 2040, contributing between $1.3 trillion and $2.4 trillion, expanding at a rate of up to 5% annually. Since renewable energy is predicted to account for the majority of the power mix between 2030 and 2050, significant investments in transmission networks, flexible power assets, and renewable energy sources will be required to meet net-zero targets. Up to 50% of the steel, copper, and aluminum needed for production will come from wind turbines alone.
Meanwhile, it is becoming more difficult to reduce inflation as global commodity prices level off, according to the World Bank's April 2024 Commodity Markets Outlook. The price decline from mid-2022 to mid-2023 was 40%, but it has since stabilized. However, since the middle of 2023, indices of commodities prices has largely not altered. The World Bank projects that global commodity prices will fall by 3% in 2024 and 4% in 2025, assuming that geopolitical tensions do not flare up again. Inflation will continue to rise above central bank targets despite this modest decline as per the report World Bank.
Oil prices are still high as the world economy is going down; Brent crude is expected to average $84 a barrel by 2024, as per the World Bank. Prices might rise above $100 in the event of global upheaval, providing investors in oil substantial profits. Secondly, due to geopolitical uncertainty and the robust demand from central banks in developing countries, gold is predicted to reach record highs in 2024. This confirms gold's reputation as a ""safe haven"" asset in times of market volatility.
Moreover, the demand for metals like copper and aluminum is being driven by investments in green technologies. Already at a two-year high, copper prices are predicted to grow by 5% in 2024, while aluminum prices are forecasted to rise by 2% due to rising demand for renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicles.
On the other hand, a report from a large US bank stated that, in May, commodity prices reached all-time highs, driven by increases of 74% in only 1.5 months for U.S. natural gas, copper, gold, and cocoa. A retreat in June was brought on by profit-taking and worries about the U.S. economic slowdown. By year's end, Natasha Kaneva projects a 10% growth in the commodity market, citing weather-related supply chain disruptions and favorable fundamentals that might raise the price of gas, oil, and agricultural products. Energy transition commodities may see more gains from China's decarbonization initiatives, and gold prices may reach $2,600/oz by 2025 as a result of Fed rate cuts and central bank easing.
We sifted through holdings of commodity ETFs to form an initial list of 20 commodity stocks. Then we selected the 13 stocks that had the highest upside potential based on analysts' consensus. We have only included stocks in our list with an upside potential of 30% or higher. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the upside potential.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Upside Potential: 63.31%
Iron ore and pellets are produced worldwide by Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), a sizable mining company. To focus on iron ore, nickel, and copper, the company sold off noncore assets including its steel, coal, and fertilizer businesses in recent years. The bulk materials division, which mainly sells iron ore and iron ore pellets, accounts for the majority of earnings. The relatively smaller base metals category consists of copper mines that produce copper in concentrate and nickel mines and smelters. It has decided to sell a minority 13% ownership in energy transition metals, its base metals business, which is slated to go into effect in 2024 and is likely the first step in separating base metals from iron ore.
The Q2 2024 performance of Vale met analysts' expectations. The primary driver of earnings, iron ore sales volumes, jumped by 25% from the previous quarter and by 7% YoY. Although first-half sales volumes of 144 million metric tons are 10% higher YoY, Vale maintained its guidance for 2024 output of 310 million to 320 million metric tons. Analysts believe 2024 sales volumes are likely to be lower than production, as has generally been the case in recent years, despite the strong first half and sales generally being greater in the second half due to seasonal factors. Therefore, Morningstar analysts have kept the 2024 iron ore sales prediction at 305 million metric tons, which is unchanged from 2023. The quarter's average iron ore fines prices of roughly $98 per metric ton and the half-year average of $99 are in line with its full-year assumption of roughly $101.
With record iron ore output and advancements on significant expansion projects adding 30 million tonnes of capacity, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) recently reported good operational performance. Most crucially, Vale's reduced unit costs in comparison to producers in India and China, as well as high-cost producers like Anglo American, enable it to remain profitable even in low-price conditions. There are 9 analysts who have collectively rated the stock as a ""buy"", with an upside of 63%.
Overall VALE ranks 1st on our list of the best commodity stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of VALE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -Mining companies Vale and BHP, together with their joint venture Samarco, may soon reach an agreement with Brazilian authorities to pay around 100 billion reais ($17.87 billion) for the collapse of a dam in the city of Mariana, said four sources familiar with the discussions.
Three of the sources expect a final agreement to be reached in October.
The amount is more than the 82 billion reais in new resources offered in the companies' last proposal in June to compensate for the 2015 disaster, which caused a wave of toxic tailings that killed 19 people, left hundreds homeless, flooded forests and polluted a river.
($1 = 5.5955 reais)

Vale,2024-08-30,VALE S.A. (VALE) Stock Drops Despite Market Gains: Important Facts to Note,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8985e21bd3c04b5a8193dd5d65c14d4f91c4692be4965a6e99aa30d880d6c2ac,"VALE S.A. (VALE) closed at $10.52 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.28% move from the prior day.","Oops, something went wrong
VALE S.A. (VALE) closed the latest trading day at $10.52, indicating a -0.28% change from the previous session's end. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 1.01%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.55%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.13%.
Shares of the company witnessed a gain of 0.67% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Basic Materials sector with its gain of 0.78% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.5%.
The investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of VALE S.A. in its forthcoming earnings report. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $0.54, marking a 18.18% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $10.56 billion, showing a 0.62% drop compared to the year-ago quarter.
For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $2.13 per share and a revenue of $40.12 billion, demonstrating changes of +16.39% and -3.98%, respectively, from the preceding year.
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for VALE S.A. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Right now, VALE S.A. possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
From a valuation perspective, VALE S.A. is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 4.96. This expresses no noticeable deviation compared to the average Forward P/E of 4.96 of its industry.
Also, we should mention that VALE has a PEG ratio of 3.59. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Mining - Iron industry held an average PEG ratio of 3.59.
The Mining - Iron industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, placing it within the top 38% of over 250 industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

Vale,2024-08-29,VALE Moves Above 50-Day SMA on CEO Appointment: Time to Buy the Stock?,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=bbeb8f8b6bab15241fbc50c3ca33e93eff6efcb52b28b74f787feedc3f22b7b8,VALE shares gain on the announcement of Gustavo Pimenta as the CEO. We analyze whether this is a good time to invest in the stock.,"Oops, something went wrong
Vale S.A. VALE shares have gained 2% following the announcement on Aug. 26 that its current chief financial officer, Gustavo Pimenta, will take over the reins of the company as the next CEO. He will replace Eduardo Bartolomeo, whose term ends on Dec. 31, 2024.
Pimenta has been VALE’s chief financial officer since 2021. He was chosen over 14 external candidates identified by a consulting firm entrusted with the headhunting process.
This wraps up a tumultuous succession process marred by government interference and disagreements among board members. Two directors resigned, with one alleging political influence in the succession process.

The choice of Pimenta, with his previous experience in VALE and being free from government influence, has been received well by investors.
The VALE stock broke through its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) on Aug. 26, indicating a short-term bullish trend. The 50-day SMA is a key indicator for traders and analysts, often marking the first sign of an uptrend or a downtrend.
Given the recent uptick in Vale’s shares and the conclusion of the appointment process, is this the right time to buy? Let us find out.

Despite the recent increase, VALE shares have lost 32.6% year to date. The stock has also underperformed the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector’s 2.5% decline and the S&P 500’s climb of 17.9%.
Declining Iron Ore Prices: The company’s price performance mainly mirrors the downtrend in iron ore prices as China’s prolonged property crisis has weighed on its demand. Iron ore prices are currently at $98.51 per ton, the lowest level in 20 months.
The World Steel Association expects steel demand in China in 2024 to be flat with that reported in 2023 due to declining real estate investments. This suggests that a near-term price recovery is unlikely.
Rising Costs: In the first quarter of 2024, VALE reported a 9% year-over-year decline in pro-forma adjusted EBITDA and the same was down 6% in the second quarter. The downfall was attributed to higher costs and expenses related to freight and maintenance activities. The combination of low iron prices, weak demand and elevated expenses is concerning.
Unresolved Mariana Dam Negotiations: On Nov. 5, 2015, the Fundão tailings dam at the Samarco Mariana Mining Complex collapsed. It claimed 19 lives, and led to environmental and community impacts. The dam was owned and operated by Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Group’s BHP subsidiary. Vale, Samarco and BHP are in negotiations with Brazilian authorities to seek a settlement for the claims related to the incident.
The speculation regarding the CEO selection over the past few months has also been impacting its share price.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 and 2025 has moved south over the past 60 days. This reflects the impacts of a decline in iron ore prices and its weak production guidance. Vale expects iron ore production in 2024 to be near the top end of its guidance of 310-320 Mt. This indicates a decline from the 321 Mt of iron ore produced in 2023.

Despite the near-term challenges, the company is well-positioned for long-term growth on the back of several catalysts.
Solid Project Pipeline: VALE is making progress on major growth projects like Vargem Grande and Capanema, which are expected to add 30 million tons of capacity over the next 12 months. Also, the S11D plus 20 million ton expansion project is scheduled to start in 2026 and will support production growth. It will also continue to focus on improving the quality of its portfolio.
Projects such as Salobo III and Alemão will increase copper production capacity and the development of the Cristalino project will help extend the life of the Sossego mill. Vale continues to develop studies of the Hu'u project in Indonesia, a world-class asset, and is investing in the exploration of assets in mining regions considered to be prolific, such as Andean America and Eastern Europe.
For 2026, Vale expects its nickel production between 230 kt and 245 kt, considering replenishment projects in Canada, contributions from Pomalaa and Morowali, and the start-up of the second furnace at Onça Puma. In 2030, nickel production will likely cross the 300-kt mark, with input from projects such as Thompson Ultramafics, Sorowako HPAL, partnership projects and offtake.
Positive Long-Term Outlook for Prices: Growth in world steel production, spurred by urbanization, will fuel demand for iron ore and support its prices. Copper and nickel demand will also rise, driven by the electric vehicle market and renewable energy investments.
The company’s current dividend yield of 11.13% is higher than the sector’s 2.52% and the S&P 500’s 1.26%. Its payout rate is at 57.96%, also higher than the sector’s 54.05% and the S&P 500’s 33.79%.
The company is trading at a forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio of 1.14X at a discount to the sector’s 2.40X.

The stock is also cheaper than other iron miners like Rio Tinto RIO, Fortescue Ltd FSUGY and BHP Group, which are trading at 1.56, 2.23 and 2.48, respectively.
Pimenta has his work cut out when he takes up the CEO office in January 2025. Per chairman Daniel Stieler, safety and creating value for the company by ensuring production stability should be the top priorities. This will be challenging, considering the weak demand prospects in China. He is also expected to aid in negotiations and help reach a settlement in the Mariana dam dispute.
Considering the challenging near-term outlook for the iron ore industry, Vale’s tepid production guidance for 2024 and elevated costs, we believe that investors should wait for a better entry point. Those who already own this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock should stay invested to benefit from the company’s solid project portfolio and the long-term positive outlook for iron ore prices, copper and nickel.

Vale,2024-08-29,Is VALE (VALE) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b0e5f83d9e221b41d2f7de4bc644f94c885b1434ed5d4fad057088a36a74e820,"The average brokerage recommendation (ABR) for VALE (VALE) is equivalent to a Buy. The overly optimistic recommendations of Wall Street analysts make the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric questionable. So, is it worth buying the stock?","Oops, something went wrong
The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?
Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about VALE S.A. (VALE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.
VALE currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 50% and 7.1% of all recommendations.
Check price target & stock forecast for VALE here>>>While the ABR calls for buying VALE, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.
Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.
Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.
On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for VALE, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.13.
Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for VALE. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for VALE.

(Reuters) -     Amazon said on Wednesday it will exclusively stream 21 New York Yankees regular games on its Prime Video service for the upcoming 2025 season, as streaming companies face increasing competition to broadcast live sporting events.
The baseball games will be live streamed at no extra cost to Prime Video members living in New York State, Connecticut, north and central New Jersey and northeast Pennsylvania -- areas that cover a majority of the fanbase of the New York Yankees.
Live sports, a prerogative of cable television for decades, is swiftly moving to digital platforms to tap the larger audience that is ditching cable TV subscriptions for digital streaming platforms.
Streaming bellwether Netflix has increased its investments towards acquiring live sports content, including high-profile events such as the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match, aiming to diversify its portfolio and attract a broader audience.
It also paid more than $5 billion to be the exclusive home of World Wrestling Entertainment's Raw in several territories from January this year and is considering a bid for Formula 1's U.S. TV rights, according to media reports.
This has prompted competing digital platforms, including Prime Video, to stream more live sporting events to drive subscriber growth and enhance their advertising revenue, as live events tend to draw large, engaged audiences.
Prime Video currently streams the NBA, Thursday Night Football, NASCAR, Seattle Kraken and Overtime Elite among others in the U.S.

DBRS Limited (Morningstar DBRS) confirmed its credit ratings on the following classes of Amazon Seattle Loan-Specific Certificates issued by Benchmark 2021-B25 Mortgage Trust.
Class 300P-A at A (high) (sf)
Class 300P-B at BBB (high) (sf)
Class 300P-C at BB (sf)
Class 300P-D at B (sf)
Class 300P-E at B (low) (sf)
Class 300P-RR at B (low) (sf)
All trends are Stable.
The credit rating confirmations reflect the stable performance of the underlying collateral, which remains in line with Morningstar DBRS' expectations at the last credit rating action in April 2024. The Amazon Seattle Loan-Specific Certificates are secured by the fee-simple interest in a Class A office property known as Amazon Seattle, as well as its leasehold interest in a parking lease covering certain spaces at an adjacent parking garage. Amazon Seattle is a redeveloped Class A office building in the heart of the Seattle central business district and consists of approximately 680,000 square feet (sf) of office space and 94,000 sf of retail space. The $455 million whole loan is composed of $234.9 million of senior A notes, one junior B note of $155.1 million (the Amazon Seattle Trust Subordinate Companion Loan), and a mezzanine loan of $65 million. The Amazon Loan-Specific Certificates total $155.1 million and are collateralized by only the Amazon Seattle Trust Subordinate Companion Loan. The interest-only loan is structured with an anticipated repayment date in April 2030 and a final maturity date in May 2033.
The property was originally constructed in 1929 as the flagship location of prominent Seattle-based department store The Bon Marche and has since been granted landmark status by the city of Seattle. In 2017, the previous owner began a three-phase, comprehensive transformation to convert the property into office space for Amazon. The previous owner completed the first two phases of the project at a cost of $160.0 million and the final phase of the repositioning project, Amazon's final expansion and conversion, was completed and all of Amazon's space was delivered by February 2022 in accordance with the loan agreement.
According to the September 2024 rent roll, the property is 94.6% leased to four tenants. The office component of the collateral is fully occupied by investment-grade tenant Amazon (88.3% of the net rentable area) on a triple net lease that extends through May 2033, with three five-year renewal options available. There are no future termination options or outs in the lease. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the Amazon lease is guaranteed by the parent company, Amazon.com, Inc., however, the guarantee cap amount is scheduled to reduce each year until the lease's initial expiry in 2033. Although the site inspection dated August 2024 noted that physical occupancy at the office was approximately 10% given work-from-home flexibility, as per recent media articles, Amazon revised its return to office mandate to five-days per week beginning in January 2025, marking a significant increase in foot traffic in downtown Seattle since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Reis, office properties within the Central Seattle submarket reported an average vacancy rate of 21.0% in Q4 2024, a slight increase from 20.0% in Q4 2023; however, the five-year forecasted vacancy rate is expected to decrease to 15.3%. Despite the softening submarket metrics, Amazon has demonstrated its commitment to the property by completing various amenity projects during the pandemic to revitalize the space. As per the financial statement for the trailing-six-month period ended June 30, 2024, the annualized net cash flow (NCF) was reported at $26.8 million, lower than the Morningstar DBRS NCF of $29.0 million, which applies straight-line credit to Amazon's rent over the loan term given its consideration as a long-term credit tenant.
The April 2024 Morningstar DBRS credit rating analysis and action included an updated collateral valuation. For more information regarding the approach and analysis conducted, please refer to the press release titled 'Morningstar DBRS Takes Rating Actions on North American Single-Asset/Single-Borrower Transactions Backed by Office Properties,' published on April 15, 2024. Morningstar DBRS maintained the valuation approach from the April 2024 review, which was based on a capitalization rate of 7.50% applied to the Morningstar DBRS net cash flow of $29.0 million. Morningstar DBRS also maintained positive qualitative adjustments to the loan-to-value ratio sizing benchmarks totaling 6.0% to reflect the subject property's quality and generally long-term in-place tenancy of the investment-grade tenant. The Morningstar DBRS concluded value of $386.9 million represents a -39.9% variance from the issuance appraised value of $644.0 million.
Morningstar DBRS' credit ratings on the applicable classes address the credit risk associated with the identified financial obligations in accordance with the relevant transaction documents. Where applicable, a description of these financial obligations can be found in the transactions' respective press releases at issuance.
Morningstar DBRS' long-term credit ratings provide opinions on risk of default. Morningstar DBRS considers risk of default to be the risk that an issuer will fail to satisfy the financial obligations in accordance with the terms under which a long-term obligation has been issued. The Morningstar DBRS short-term debt rating scale provides an opinion on the risk that an issuer will not meet its short-term financial obligations in a timely manner.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS
There were no Environmental/Social/Governance factors that had a significant or relevant effect on the credit analysis.

AMZN

(Reuters) -European satellite company SES beat annual core profit estimates on Wednesday, helped by strong commercial activity even as it faces stiff competition from new players offering an alternative to traditional satellite service providers.
Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew slightly to 1.03 billion euros ($1.08 billion) in 2024, while analysts had expected it to drop to 994 million euros, a survey compiled by the company showed.
Already buried under billions of euros of debt, Europe's legacy satellite operators are being challenged by the rising popularity of Elon Musk's Starlink and Amazon's Kuiper.
Unlike Starlink's 7,000 low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites bringing internet access to consumers, SES manages a multi-orbit network of around 70 geostationary (GEO) and medium Earth orbit(MEO) satellites that provide connectivity for a wide range of markets including aviation, maritime, military and governments.
SES said its acquisition of Intelsat, announced last year, was on track to be completed in the second half of 2025 after receiving regulatory clearances.
The Luxembourg-based satellite operator also forecast stable growth for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA in 2025.
SPECTRUM OPPORTUNITIES
SES has made billions of euros in recent years through its C-band clearing activities in the U.S. and may benefit from new openings after acquiring Intelsat.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission will decide on Thursday whether it will move forward with plans to free up new spectrum.
C-band is a segment of the spectrum used by satellite service providers to broadcast video and radio content to 120 million households in the United States.
SES and Intelsat have historically been the largest holders of these coveted frequencies, instrumental in 5G deployment, accounting for more than 90% of the services provided.
However, their leadership in the market could be diminished due to emerging competitors such as Musk's Space X.
In January, Space X's vice president of satellite policy, David Goldman, suggested in a letter to FCC Secretary Marlene Dortch that the C-band should be shared among other players after the SES-Intelsat merger.

AMZN

For years, the Northern District of Illinois (NDIL) has been the leading venue for design patent owners seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief against numerous merchants in a single litigation (the so-called ""Schedule A"" cases) for sales of allegedly infringing products on e-commerce platforms, frequently shipped out from locations in mainland China to retail buyers in the United States (including goods available for delivery to Illinois). Federal judges in NDIL routinely find personal jurisdiction over these defendants based on sales that can be (or are) directed to consumers located in the district. The district court regularly accepts the patentee's boilerplate arguments about the court's jurisdiction over the online storefront operators, anchored in language like:
Defendants have targeted sales to Illinois residents by setting up and operating e-commerce stores that target United States consumers using one or more Seller Aliases, offer shipping to the United States, including Illinois, accept payment in U.S. dollars and/or funds from U.S. bank accounts, and, on information and belief, have sold products featuring [patentee's] patented design to residents of Illinois.1
However, the reverse—when the would-be infringer initiates to lawsuit to have its rights adjudicated in NDIL—is not always true, because the courts may decline to find personal jurisdiction over the patent owner in the same type of online commercial dispute. A pair of recent rulings from the district bear this out, highlighting potential asymmetrical treatment of accused infringers and rights-holders in the busiest Schedule A forum in the country.
In Zhifu Network Technology Co., Ltd (Shenzhen) v. Core Home Fitness, LLC, Case No. 1:24-cv-11277, a Chinese company (patent challenger) that was prevented from selling its dumbbell weights on Amazon.com nationwide (including in Illinois) sued the patentee, an out-of-state company that also marketed and offered competing products for sale to Illinois, which had filed complaints with Amazon that triggered delisting of the plaintiff's products. To establish the court's personal jurisdiction over the patentee, the patent challenger's Complaint used nearly identical language as that quoted above, referencing the patentee's targeting of business activities towards consumers in Illinois via its e-commerce store, etc., but in its February 5, 2025 ruling the court dismissed the patent challenger's suit for lack of personal jurisdiction over the patentee and improper venue. The Zhifu court reasoned that the patentee's having ""complain[ed] to Amazon"" from another state—thereby causing Amazon to delist the plaintiff's product globally—was too attenuated to show the patentee ""purposefully directed"" its activities at Illinois (without which, being forced to defend the lawsuit in NDIL would violate Constitutional Due Process safeguards).
Contemporaneously, in Aixining Trading Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen) v. Nengwu He, Case No. 1:24-cv-11459, another NDIL district judge considered a similar fact pattern. Again, a PRC-based seller brought a declaratory judgment action against an out-of-state patent-owner who had caused the seller's products to be delisted from Amazon.com and who had failed to appear in court. An additional wrinkle in the facts was that Amazon had reinstated the seller's listings before the seller filed suit. In its February 7, 2025 ruling against the seller, the court used the same rationale as the Zhifu court to find that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the patentee-defendant (who had no contacts with the forum and whose actions had ""not in any way ... uniquely targeted Illinois""). In addition, the court further determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction as well. With the listings back online, the seller had no actual, immediate injury for the federal judiciary to redress, and therefore no actual case or controversy as required by Article III of the Constitution.
These and other recent NDIL rulings illustrate how the federal court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over litigants looking to adjudicate their rights with respect to potentially infringing (or non-infringing) sales on e-commerce platforms is not a two-way street. Rather, it one-sidedly favors the patentee-plaintiff who chooses NDIL as the forum to find and stop infringing sales; and conversely turns away the declaratory judgement plaintiff seeking to prove and resume non-infringing sales in the district.
Despite the seeming double standard, these rulings are not inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's SnapRays v. Lighting Defense Group decision from last year. In SnapRays, the appellate court held that a patentee's mere use of the APEX (Amazon Patent Evaluation Express) process or other informal platform-based dispute mechanisms can create an Article III case or controversy that opens the patentee up to a declaratory judgment action by the at-risk seller in the seller's home state, where the intended delisting ""would necessarily affect marketing, sales, and other activities within [that state].""
Here, the NDIL courts required a similar showing of enforcement activity targeted at its venue, concluding that a patentee's actions in initiating an Amazon takedown, without more, do not constitute purposeful direction of enforcement activities at Illinois. Rather, in Zhifu, the court recommended the seller bring suit in the patentee's home state of Ohio where patentee ""conducted all of its patent enforcement activity,"" and in Aixining, the court ordered the plaintiff to clarify the ""contacts that Defendant made with Illinois."" In sum, while an aggrieved merchant may sue the out-of-state patentee, NDIL is unlikely to be the proper forum in most cases unless the patentee singled out Illinois in its enforcement efforts.
Takeaways
On the one hand, patentees who complain about a merchant's questionable listing to the e-commerce platform or submit an I.P. dispute to its informal resolution process should expect this communication to give rise to a real case or controversy—i.e., the merchant could immediately seek a federal district court's adjudication as to non-infringement and/or invalidity of the U.S. patent. Even so, the patentee can reasonably expect to defend that suit where it is domiciled, unless its enforcement activity was also aimed at another forum (such as the home state of a targeted domestic merchant).
On the other hand, domestic and foreign e-commerce sellers should know that the NDIL's willingness to exercise jurisdiction over the same set of litigants when the patentee brings suit does not guarantee access to the same forum when the seller chooses to be the plaintiff. Depending on the facts, the district court in the seller's home state (if it is a domestic entity)—or, as a fallback, the patentee's home state—may be where the seller must initiate its declaratory judgment action.

The print-on-demand industry saw major shifts in 2024, with landmark mergers, tech innovations, and social commerce growth. Key partnerships like Canva & HP and Shutterfly & Amazon Prime reshaped the market, while TikTok Shop hit $32.6B in transactions. As 2025 begins, AI-powered fulfillment, automation, and e-commerce expansion will drive the next wave of industry transformation.
The print-on-demand industry underwent significant transformation in 2024, setting the stage for compelling developments in 2025. Let's examine the key events that shaped the industry last year and explore the trends that will define its future.
2024: A Year of Strategic Transformation
The past year brought substantial changes to the print-on-demand landscape, fundamentally altering how businesses operate and compete in this space.
Industry Consolidation Reshapes the Market
The industry witnessed historic consolidation in 2024, marked by the landmark mergers between Printful and Printify and S&S and alphabroder. These tie-ups signaled a clear shift in market dynamics and continue to reflect an evolving industry where scale and operational efficiency have become increasingly crucial. It wasn't long ago that the print on-demand production and distribution markets were highly fragmented. The consolidation we saw in 2024 was a clear indicator that the standard for scale has changed: a multi-facility, global presence is now a prerequisite for meaningful market presence.
Strategic Partnerships Drive Innovation
2024 was a year of partnerships. Collaborations continue to be a primary growth catalyst, with several notable announcements redefining market possibilities. Canva's strategic alliance with HP indicates a focus on global print quality consistency, while Shutterfly's partnership with Amazon Prime highlighted the continued importance of logistical excellence and fast shipping. Adobe's integration with Zazzle brought streamlined print functionality to Adobe Express, and Fanatics secured valuable partnerships with World Rugby and Juventus, strengthening its position in sports merchandise.
A Year of Technology, Innovation, and Social Commerce
The market welcomed innovative new software platforms in 2024, with Gelato introducing GelatoConnect and Gooten launching OrderMesh. Society6's comprehensive redesign on Shopify demonstrated the industry's commitment to enhanced user experience and YouTube too focused on streamlined experiences by introducing Creator Collections to make it easier for creators to promote and sell merchandise. Social commerce continued its impressive growth, with Tik Tok Shop reaching $32.6bn in transaction volume last year. Etsy had a leadership shake-up and Shopify posted record Q4 results, while Merch By Amazon relaxed admission requirements for creators making the Amazon marketplace even more competitive.

NEW YORK (AP) — In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, Amazon MGM announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.
Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights — but Amazon MGM will have creative control.
Financial terms weren’t disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.
“With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,” Wilson said in a statement. “Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.”
Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007 concluded with 2021's “No Time to Die,” Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.
The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in the more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.
“We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theatres around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,” said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. “We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.”
Bond had been a family business since Albert “Cubby” Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming’s novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962’s “Dr. No.” Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in box office.
In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.
“My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,” Broccoli said in a statement. “I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of ‘No Time to Die’ and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.”
A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will surely lead to doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned “Star Wars” and Marvel brands, have in recent years struggled with over-saturation.
In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.
“People are playing it very safe,” Broccoli said. “I think in times of crisis like this, you’ve got to be brave.”

eero 7 is the company’s most affordable Wi-Fi 7 router, offering multi-gigabit speeds in a compact form factor

eero Pro 7 delivers premium Wi-Fi 7 performance for high-bandwidth connectivity needs, offering fast wireless and wired speeds with two 5 GbE ports, and capacity for hundreds of devices
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced that eero is expanding its Wi-Fi 7 portfolio to include eero 7, delivering multi-gigabit speeds at a more affordable price, and eero Pro 7, offering premium performance for bandwidth-demanding networks. Thanks to the company’s TrueMesh, TrueRoam, and TrueChannel networking technologies, and the latest Wi-Fi 7 capabilities, eero 7 and Pro 7 will improve overall wifi performance, reliability, and latency; and help keep customers connected even as network conditions become more complex and demanding.
“For ten years, eero has obsessed over delivering exceptional wifi because we know it is as important as our electricity and running water. Back in my apartment in San Francisco, our ambition was to deliver an experience that's easy to use, is so reliable you don't have to think about it, comes with world-class security, and is thoughtfully designed to blend into any environment,” said Nick Weaver, CEO and co-founder of eero. “We've continued to innovate and have gone well beyond our first home mesh wifi system—there are tens of millions of eero devices that power homes and businesses across 24 countries. Today, I’m excited for the eero 7 and Pro 7 to join the Max 7 and Outdoor 7 and expand our Wi-Fi 7 portfolio to meet every internet need.”
eero 7—Wi-Fi 7 performance at a more affordable price
eero 7 is a multi-gigabit router for customers who rely on their wifi for every-day internet activities, like streaming, studying, and working, and are looking to upgrade to the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard at a lower price. eero 7 is a dual-band system with support for 2.4 and 5 GHz, and can deliver wireless speeds up to 1.8 Gbps and wired speeds up to 2.3 Gbps through its two 2.5 GbE ports. eero 7 delivers Wi-Fi 7 performance in a compact form factor that can easily fit on bookshelves, entertainment centers, and desks.
A single unit covers up to 2,000 square feet, providing a simple way to start a network in an apartment or small home; a two-pack covers up to 4,000 square feet; and a three-pack covers up to 6,000 square feet. Customers can connect as many eero devices as they need to get coverage throughout their homes.
eero Pro 7—Next-generation speed and reliability
eero Pro 7 is for more demanding customers who have high-bandwidth needs, want enough capacity to connect hundreds of devices, or live in a household with multiple people streaming content, playing online games, and working from home. It’s a tri-band system with support for 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz, providing more wireless spectrum to increase overall network capacity and avoid congestion, which helps improve performance when there are busy neighboring networks. eero Pro 7 can deliver wireless speeds up to 3.9 Gbps and wired speeds up to 4.7 Gbps through its two 5 GbE ports, making it ideal for customers with multigigabit plans and demanding internet needs.
eero Pro 7 also features the same fan-less, advanced passive thermal design as eero Max 7 that is silent and limits dust build-up. A single unit covers up to 2,000 square feet and 200 devices; a two-pack covers up to 4,000 square feet and over 400 devices; and a three-pack covers up to 6,000 square feet and over 600 devices.
